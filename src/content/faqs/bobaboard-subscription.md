title: Can&apos;t I just support you by buying a premium BobaBoard account?
order: 1000

<p>
    While BobaBoard is the main project I work on, I work on a lot more
    than BobaBoard. It&apos;s important that I continue doing so for the
    long-term success of our goals.

    Even more importantly, there are many reasons why tying my ability to
    survive to the success of the social software I build is a bad, bad
    idea. While this might end up being its own blog post at some point,
    for now I ask you trust me: if you want to see more of what I do,
    please donate to me directly.
