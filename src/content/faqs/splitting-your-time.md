title: How are you splitting your time these days? What am I supporting?
order: 100

As my [projects page](/projects) hopefully conveys, I work on an ecle

These days (early 2024), I'm proritizing the following projects:

1. **Shipping FujoGuide Volume 0:** not only [a succesful
   Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/essential-randomness/the-fujoshi-guide-to-web-development)
   deserves a successful delivery, but making Git+GitHub accessible to a new
   public will redefine who can be building the web of tomorrow
2. **Secret WIP project:** Not ready to talk about it yet, but it fits nicely
   with everything else :)
3. **My Own Worksona:** My professional online presence, including this website.
   In 2024, I must start bringing in enough money so I can continue empowering
   myself and others to build towards a better future for the web
4. **BobaBoard Community Handoff:** [BobaBoard](https://www.bobaboard.com) (the
   main project I've worked on since 2020) is ready to leave its cozy nest and
   be embraced by the broader web. To that end, I'm helping transition the
   project from being led by me to being led by its own community.

Your support buys you early access to news about these projects (and beyond), as well as my
eternal gratitude. Refer to the tier cards for more info!
