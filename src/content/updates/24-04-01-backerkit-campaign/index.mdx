Terminal rests upon her shoulder for moral support. A raccoon fursuit head is stacked on a shelf; a beautiful and food-safe wooden cheese board emblazoned with the word “yaoi” hangs from the wall. In the foreground are Git, curled up and fast asleep with little z’s floating near him, and GitHub, perched upon a stack of books and ready to pounce."

## **✨🍋FujoCoded, LLC✨**

Last year, we took a bold step by fundraising for [a fan-friendly guide to
modern web
development](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/essential-randomness/the-fujoshi-guide-to-web-development).
Today, it’s time for our next step: **establishing a sustainable way forward by
formalizing our ongoing work under a real company** with an official mission!

FujoCoded LLC's mission is to **build a kinder, more diverse, more
collaborative–and unapologetically _weirder_–internet.**

Our main focuses:

- **Education**, which gives people the skills to be the change they want to see
  on the web.
- **Software**, which gives people the tools to make such changes.
- **Community**, which gives people the strength, structure, and support to see
  those changes through.

...but just like last year, to get this new company started right we need **your
help**. You could even say we NEED YOUR SEED….
