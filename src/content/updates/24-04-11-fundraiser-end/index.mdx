    alt="FujoCoded Campaign Showcase  The FujoCoded logo (a lemon with a bite out of it) above artwork of Boba-tan. A sparkling star is the dot on both the j in FujoCoded and the i in Campaign. The image is primarily yellow, with sky blue in the art.  On a bright day with just a few fluffy clouds in the sky, Boba-tan kneels down to gently cover a seed with soil. She is wearing a straw hat and smiling warmly. Nearby, a worm inches its way past her."

With our campaign now concluded, we're happy to say [**we raised $9,258 from 170
backers**](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/fujocoded-llc/fujocoded-software-and-education-for-a-better-web?preview_token=pRP66u0ywMO)**,
a whopping 309% of our goal**. This means that we not only hit all our planned
stretch goals, we even hit an extra one we improvised (a commemorative "it's
over 9000" Boba-tan sticker).

We've published a longer wrap-up thread on our socials, where you can learn more
about the final tally and next steps, as well as everyone who made this campaign
possible.
