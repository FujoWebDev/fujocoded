Welcome fujoshi, fudanshi, fujin, and friends/allies to our first dedicated newsletter for FujoCoded, LLC!

## About This Newsletter

After our well-deserved break (and some time heads down in logistics), we‚Äôre finally back with regular communications! Keeping with our new projects-wide schedule, **this newsletter will go out to our subscribers once a month.**

In the near future, you can expect to see the following:

- Updates on the followthrough for the FujoCoded LLC BackerKit campaign
- Updates on the production of the Fujoshi Guide to Web Development
- Up-to-date info on our streaming schedule and other initiatives we‚Äôll be running

Other content will be added in the future as our little venture spreads its wings and takes flight.

If you receive backer updates for either the FujoGuide or the FujoCoded LLC campaign, **you'll notice that the relevant sections in this newsletter will be recycled into our monthly campaign updates** to save our comms team time and effort. So you don't have to read through multiple emails hunting for extra content‚Äîit's all here, baby!

## FujoCoded LLC BackerKit Campaign

### Recent Progress

With guidance from folks who‚Äôve shipped rewards for other campaigns, **we‚Äôve made some impressive strides toward fulfillment** for those of you who backed our campaign. To date, we have:

- **Made a detailed fulfillment plan**, including a breakdown of all tasks needed and an aspirational timeline to help us pace ourselves
- **Ordered samples** of both T-shirts and tote bags to double-check sizing, quality, and placement of the graphics
- **Commissioned art** for the promised bonus ‚ÄúOver 9000!‚Äù Boba-tan sticker to commemorate raising over $9000 to launch Fujocoded, LLC!

We‚Äôve also started putting the money you all helped raise to its intended use: **working on getting our shiny new company ready to go.** Here‚Äôs what that looks like so far:

- Started informally talking to the folks who contacted us to offer legal services‚Äîthanks for all your help getting the word out!
- **Researched legal precedent** regarding for-profit organizations and volunteer labor to make sure we do right by our generous community contributors‚Ä¶ and to make sure we can ask smart questions when we talk to our legal counsel ü§ì
- **Began working on an ‚ÄúArticle‚Äù section to** [**fujoweb.dev**](http://fujoweb.dev)**.** In the future, that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll be able to find the articles we‚Äôre going to commission with the money you helped us raise.

### What‚Äôs Next

There‚Äôs lots left to do, but we know what our next steps are:

- **Prepare the BackerKit backer survey** so that everyone gets their rewards in the size, color, and design they want, shipped to them as cheaply as possible
- **Officially reach out to legal counsel** to finalize employment contracts for future FujoCoded contract workers
- **Stream the completion of the hidden Sponsor Wall section of the FujoCoded home page.** This will be in just a hour [on Twitch!](https://www.twitch.tv/essentialrandomness)

## FujoGuide Kickstarter Campaign

### Recent Progress

Though we did take a few weeks to focus on launching FujoCoded, LLC, we‚Äôre back at it with more progress on the Fujoshi Guide to Web Development:

- **Vol. 1, Issue 1: Git is being prepared for early release** to our KickStarter backers so that we can get feedback from all of _YOU_ while we are working on the final art! Instead of final art, the early release version will have Ms Boba‚Äôs hilarious sketches, which should honestly count as bonus content üëç
- **Vol. 1, Issue 2: GitHub** is (almost) entirely written! Ms Boba put her head down and powered through the Guide‚Äôs main scenario, leaving just the ‚Äúextra credits‚Äù sections to be finalized before our first beta round (soon to be scheduled). Excited to see how this issue‚Äôs exercise resonates with our readers!
- **We have started work on the FujoGuide wiki**, which will house any and all online reference content mentioned in the text of the guide itself.

### What‚Äôs Next

- **The text-and-sketches early-release version of Vol. 1, Issue 1: Git** **will be sent out as a PDF to KickStarter backers** via BackerKit‚Äôs reward delivery tool. We don‚Äôt have an exact date, but our _wide-eyed idealist dream_ is to get it to you around the end of June ü§û
- **Vol. 1, Issue 2: GitHub** **will be handed over to a volunteer for high-level ‚Äúalpha‚Äù feedback** so we can make adjustments prior to the first round of beta reading. We‚Äôll also start planning the schedule of our first beta feedback round.
- Next Thursday, Ms Boba will be **livestreaming a look at how we‚Äôre using Astro to build FujoGuide**‚Äôs print layout and web version at the same time! Since our streams will focus on the work we must do for fulfillment, expect FujoGuide to pop up from time to time. Check out the schedule below, and come say hi!

## Hang Out with FujoCoded on Twitch üí¨‚ú®

For the rest of May and through all of June, M**s Boba will be streaming only once a week** while she focuses on fulfillment for the recently concluded BackerKit campaign to launch FujoCoded LLC, and on wrapping up the writing for FujoGuide Volume 0.

There may be an extra bonus stream here or there, so keep an eye on our social media! You can check [Ms Boba‚Äôs ‚Äústreaming schedule‚Äù page here.](https://essentialrandomness.com/streams)
