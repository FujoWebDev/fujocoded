Hello again fujoshi, fudanshi, fujin, and friends! We’ve been busy this past
month, so there’s lots to share.

Without further ado, let's head into it!

## Exploring Sociocracy

As a company, we’ve been thinking hard about how we want to structure FujoCoded
LLC. We've always known that being a top-down, hierarchical company does not
align with our ethos, but that doesn't mean we can just forego any type of
structure. Unfortunately, effective shared governance is a tough problem to
solve with sneaky pitfalls around every corner!

**After a lot of research, we’re now looking into a [non-hierarchical governance
system called Sociocracy.](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/sociocracy/)** This
past week, we had our first asynchronous brainstorming session about what
different ‘domains’ we would need to account for as we implement a sociocratic
structure for ourselves. There is still a long way to go, but we're excited by
the possibilities this model opens.

We may be a Limited Liability Corporation, but that doesn’t mean we have to
follow the capitalist model of corporate governance! Thanks for helping us try
something different, and look forward to more updates with our progress in this
area 😎

## Project Updates

And now here are the updates on our current major projects…

### Recent Progress on our BackerKit Campaign

As a precursor to sending our backers survey, wherein backers will be able to
confirm their rewards selection and add new ones, **we made one last push to
finalize all our add-ons.** This included:

- Creating two variations on the bonus IT’S OVER 9000! sticker design to
  celebrate the campaign’s final total
- Confirming the art that will be used for the stickers themselves, which
  include comparing different-sized options and making final decisions about
  what sizes would fit best on everyone’s laptops and notebooks
- Launching the sponsor wall we’d started coding during the campaign to showcase
  our higher-tier backers. (You can see it by [inputting the konami code on our
  website](https://fujocoded.com/), or by clicking the buttons in the footer!)
- Visiting local screen printing shops to make a final decision about the size
  and fabric weight we’ll use for our tote bags (after the online samples we got
  failed to meet our quality standards)
- Preparing our test containers of ✨Git’s catboy bathwater✨, personally filled &
  sealed by Ms Boba’s own hands

When all that was dialed in, we put together the backer survey and submitted it
to BackerKit for review. They gave us a few minor improvements to make, and now
the survey is finally ready!

#### FujoCoded Storefront

**We’ve also begun working with one of our longtime collaborators to build out
the FujoCoded storefront**, where much of the merchandise offered during our
BackerKit campaign will eventually become available for purchase and help us
start covering some of our recurring expenses. (You can always [become a Patreon
supporter](https://www.patreon.com/essentialrandomness?utm_source=search) if
you’d like to contribute on an ongoing basis!)

As you’ll learn in the next section, **we haven’t been able to get shiny new
contracts from our would-be lawyers yet**, but our longtime collaborators know
us well and are comfortable continuing to work under the same informal “we will
pay you X money for Y money” contract agreements we’ve been able to make up on
our own so far. We're chomping at the bit to hear back from our legal contacts
so we can at long last offer official lawyerly contracts that fully reflect the
respect we have for the work of our contributors.

### What’s Next for the FujoCoded BackerKit Campaign

**Now that the survey is ready, backers can expect it in their inboxes later
this week.** If you’re a backer who supported us at a tier with physical
rewards, you’ll need to select your exact preferences—what color T-shirt, what
tote bag design, which FujoBoard slogan you want paired with your charcuterie
spread, etc.

- **👀 Heads up: Some of you will receive the survey early.** You’re our test
  group! Please let us know if anything about the survey is confusing, so we can
  correct it before it goes out to every other backer. We’re counting on you!
- The rest of you will receive the survey later next week. It will be sent out
  in shifts, so we can’t say exactly what day you’ll get it.
- **You’ll have until the beginning of July to fill it out.**
- (But we’ll keep pestering you about it the whole time so you don’t forget 😌)

#### Lawyering up

As we mentioned in our last edition, we did reach out to legal counsel, but
lawyers tend to be busy folks and we’re still waiting on them to reply! We’re
hopeful we’ll be able to make contact soon, and will continue pinging them in
the meantime.

With that said, **we would still love any additional lawyer recommendations in
the following domains:**

- employment law (as it relates to 1099 contractors) intellectual property law
  (as it relates to character design)
- international law (as it relates to employment and intellectual property)
- corporate law (as it relates to limited-liability
- corporations established in Wyoming.)

You can find a more detailed list of our needs in [this lawyer search document
we shared during the
campaign](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/17ucE37YOlZqbCDObHcSFkndJI3roYCrIW07xefJlFB0/mobilebasic).

### Recent Progress on the Fujoshi Guide to Web Development

The comms team would like to apologize for an off-by-one error in last month’s
newsletter. We mistakenly referred to the first volume of FujoGuide as “Volume
1” when in fact it has always been called “Volume 0.” Whoops 😅

Here’s our progress on the _correctly labeled_ volumes:

- **Vol. 0, Issue 1: Git is getting closer and closer to its day in the sun.**
  Using our new shared, centralized task list system, we’ve codified a
  step-by-step plan for delivering the digital preview of Issue 1 to our
  KickStarter backers. This will help spread the workload more evenly across our
  team and (hopefully) keep us on schedule.
- **Vol. 0, Issue 2: GitHub is fully written and reviewed**, so we’ve recruited
  beta readers! Most of them are returning betas who helped review our first
  issue, but there’s a few new faces as well, so we’ll be able to test how well
  the issue works for anyone reading them out of order.
- **FujoGuide’s Online Counterpart: **We’ve also made progress on the part of
  our website where we’ll be hosting the digital resources associated with our
  first issue (mentioned last month as a “FujoGuide Wiki”). The section is now
  in preview mode as we draft the articles that will go there.

### What’s Next for FujoGuide

**Let the beta begin:** Now that beta readers have been recruited for Vol. 0,
Issue 2, we’ve scheduled the beginning of the beta process for this coming week.

**Digital FujoGuide delivery:** As discussed above, we’ve hammered out a plan to
get our KickStarter backers a digital copy of Vol. 0, Issue 1: Git. Here’s some
of the steps we’ll be making progress on during the next month:

- Collect all artist, writer, and editor credits for the credits page
- Add a “command list” section for easy review of what readers learned in the
  issue
- Add “flavor pages” (like lore sections) to make our guide even more fun
- Create a feedback form to get feedback on the issue from our KickStarter
  audience

Once this is done, we’ll do one final styling pass and get our preview edition
ready for your inboxes!

**Digital Rewards pack:** We’ve also outlined a plan for how we’ll finalize the
Digital Rewards pack, which will benefit not only our KickStarter backers but
also folks who backed the FujoCoded LLC BackerKit campaign. Our tentative
projection is mid-July, but if we don’t hit that goal, we’ll let you know in our
next newsletter.

## Hang Out with FujoCoded [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2165402781) 💬✨

For the foreseeable future, **Ms Boba will be streaming only once a week instead
of twice.** There may be an extra bonus stream here or there, so keep an eye on
either social media or on our new permanent “streaming schedule” page.

Here’s [the schedule for upcoming Twitch
streams](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/streams)—nothing specific is
currently planned, you just get to hang out with Ms Boba as she works on
campaign fulfillment stuff and other company needs.

**June**

- _Thursday, June 20 @ 3pm PDT:_ Coworking time!
- _Thursday, June 27 @ 3pm PDT:_ Coworking time!

**July**

- _Thursday, July 4 @ 3pm PDT:_ Coworking time!
- _Thursday, July 11 @ 3pm PDT:_ Coworking time!

Speaking of streams, **we recently had a very exciting BobaBoard stream where
our founder Ms Boba walked viewers through launching their own BobaBoard
realm.** While a BobaBoard volunteer is working to add a summary to our
documentation, the BobaBoard comms team is working on cutting the recording for
time for those who prefer learning by watching. Our goal is to ensure that
anyone interested in starting their own realm has an accessible tutorial ready
to go. Watch this space!

That brings our second newsletter as an incorporated company to a close 😎
Another very full month! **Don’t hesitate to reach out if there’s any other
aspect of our blossoming business you’d like to hear about.**

Looking forward to share more progress with you next month,

The FujoCoded LLC Team (sociocratically selected seamonkeys)
