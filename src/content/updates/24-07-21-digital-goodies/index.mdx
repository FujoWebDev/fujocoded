Fujoshi, fudanshi, fujin, friends, romans, countrymen‚Äîlend us your ears! We‚Äôve
got a lot to cover.

**Cross-Campaign Reward:** First up, we‚Äôve got something that affects both the
recent FujoCoded LLC BackerKit campaign and last year‚Äôs Fujoshi Guide to Web
Development Kickstarter campaign: our Digital Goodies Pack! This pack was
included with all the pledge tiers on Kickstarter, and was also an all-seeder
reward for hitting ‚Äú100 shares of the campaign post across social media‚Äù on
BackerKit, which means almost all our supporters will get it!

The description of the pack promised you wallpapers, emojis, and ‚Äúother oddities
we can scrounge up featuring our characters,‚Äù so this month it was time to find
out what oddities we could conjure! The fulfillment team held a brainstorming
meeting, and here‚Äôs what we came up with:

- Wallpapers (desktop + phone)
- Emojis (for Discord)
- Campaign badges - get credit for helping us succeed!
- Web decorations (shimeji pet + Under Construction web banner)
- Behind the Scenes of FujoGuide character creation
- Paper dolls (based on the dress-up exercise in the FujoGuide)

Now that we have the goodies figured out, we‚Äôll be assembling the high-res files
for distribution. The delivery of the Goodies pack will align with the delivery
date for the physical rewards of the FujoCoded LLC Backerkit campaign‚Äîprobably
mid-August or early September, according to how long manufacturing takes. We‚Äôll
let backers of both campaigns know exactly when to expect something shiny in
your inboxes!

Read on for more updates on our current major projects.

## Recent Progress on our BackerKit Campaign

**Fulfillment Survey Locked In:** Last month, we warned FujoCoded LLC backers
our fulfillment survey was about to hit their inboxes. Hopefully you all
received your surveys, because the last day to fill them out was Sunday the 7th.
There _may_ unofficially still be a couple of days until we charge cards and
officially lock new entries for any last-minute stragglers, but replier‚Äôs add-on
preferences are now locked in. If you do realize you need to make a change,
please contact [contacts@fujocoded.com](mailto:contacts@fujocoded.com). You‚Äôll
still be able to change your shipping address until we get closer to shipping.

**Bonus FujoGuide Article Section:** We‚Äôve been working on the section of our
website that will contain our free educational articles, including our stretch
goal from the campaign: a how-to article on using the terminal.

- Our existing team has written the first draft of the article on Terminal to
  serve as the base for a future version.
- This rough base definitely needs love from a technical writer. This is where
  the money our BackerKit backers helped us raise comes in: while we‚Äôre still
  working on the legal and logistical side, we‚Äôre raring to engage the help of a
  dedicated contractor.

**Lawyering Up, Part 2: Electric Boogaloo:** After a few scheduling
disappointments, we have some progress to report on the legal front:

- We met with a [SELC](https://www.theselc.org/) (Sustainable Economies Law
  Center) lawyer about FujoCoded LLC‚Äôs membership structure and for help
  understanding the intricacies of employment and contract law.
- We‚Äôve had our initial meeting with a fandom-friendly IP (Intellectual
  Property) lawyer recommended to us during the campaign. In the meeting, we
  made sure we were a mutual fit, established our legal priorities, and
  discussed what kind of research and prep work we would need to do in order to
  keep legal costs down. It looks like the contract draft we‚Äôve been working on
  had the right idea! We‚Äôre getting closer to proper contracts with our artists
  and helpers.
- We‚Äôve gotten in contact with a potential employment lawyer, and will schedule
  a first meeting in the following weeks. There‚Äôs lots of research left to be
  done on our many, many legal options. We hope to have even more to share next
  time!

## What‚Äôs Next for the FujoCoded BackerKit

**Stocking Up:** Now that we‚Äôve locked in everyone‚Äôs preferences with regard to
physical rewards, we can get everything in production! That covers:

- Ordering all the stickers/totes/T-shirts/etc
- Our founder Ms Boba lovingly crafting all the FujoBoards and bottling all the
  Catboy Bathwater
- Purchasing shipping supplies in bulk Next month, we‚Äôll try to have some more
  behind-the-scenes snapshots for you. By then we‚Äôll have all the merchandise in
  our hands (we hope) and be able to show off the goods!

**Volunteer Opportunity - Legal Research:** We're looking for volunteers ready
to brave legal language and documents to create the initial drafts of our
contributor contracts by piecing together existing templates. Help us complete
our prep work and move forward with IP rights agreements for our character
designers, illustrators, and writers! No formal legal experience or license
required (although appreciated): all contracts will be extensively reviewed by
paid legal professionals before being put into use!

## Recent Progress on the Fujoshi Guide to Web Development

**Vol. 0, Issue 1: Git**

- **Playing taskmaster:** Our step-by-step plan has been very helpful in sharing
  tasks and knowledge among our team, but as often happens, getting to work on a
  task reveals even more subtasks hiding within it! Technically, our to-do list
  is now longer than it was when we started, but that‚Äôs only because we‚Äôre in
  the thick of getting work done üëç
- **‚ÄúBe gentle, it‚Äôs my first time!‚Äù:** This issue is taking longer than any
  future zine because we‚Äôre building our zine-assembling software (with Astro
  and VivlioStyle!) and figuring everything out for the first time. Some of our
  toughest challenges, like style choices for callout boxes and auto-generating
  content indexes, will carry over for future issues. In our next zine, we won‚Äôt
  have to reinvent the wheel!
- **Easy, breezy, beautiful:** We commissioned one of our long-term contributors
  and character designers to create the cover for this issue. We aren‚Äôt ready
  for the design reveal yet, but we know you‚Äôre going to love it!
- **All plugged up:** To assist with one of the more difficult aspects of
  zine-making, we‚Äôve created a suite of plugins that allow us to go from
  markdown language to a polished and fully-styleable zine with ease. Astro
  users and anyone else curious can find the styling suite in our new plugins
  repo [here](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/fujocoded-plugins). You can watch us
  create some of these plugins live [in this Twitch
  recording](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2199457680).

**Vol. 0, Issue 2: GitHub**

- **Getting Beta**: Some of our beta readers have completed their GitHub issue
  read-through! We're waiting with bated (beta‚Äôd??) breath for everyone to turn
  in their feedback for our Beta Coordinator to assemble in a final report.

**FujoGuide's Online Counterpart:** Work continues on our new companion website
where we‚Äôll be hosting the digital resources referenced in the first issue,
among other tutorials and explainers. This online part of the guide will be
available to the general public, providing an onramp for essential startup steps
like how to install Git and how to use Terminal commands. By freely sharing
these fundamentals, we hope to be of help to all aspiring online coders!

## What's Next for FujoGuide

**Asking the big questions:** After some reflections on lessons learned from
FujoCoded LLC campaign fulfillment and insight gleaned from the Vol. 0, Issue 2:
Github beta, we're considering offering our Kickstarter backers a split-delivery
schedule. We're weighing the benefits of delivering Issue 1 ahead of Issues 2 &
3, vs our original plan of scheduling delivery only after all three issues are
complete. You can read the full breakdown of the split-delivery option [here on
Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/essential-randomness/the-fujoshi-guide-to-web-development/posts/4154872).

If you're a backer, we will soon send out a supporter survey that will help us
make a final decision on how best to fulfill our commitments to you. Please only
vote once (we trust youü§û) and let us know what you think of this possibility!

**To ship or not to ship (our issue 1 preview):** As we assemble all the
necessary components of our first issue, we get closer to the moment when it‚Äôs
time to make the final call on revealing our work to our backers. A lot of the
big complex items are out of the way, but we‚Äôll soon be faced with the biggest
item of them all: doing one final styling and readability pass to make our guide
as pretty as it can be and to try to catch as many typos as we can!

## Hang Out with FujoCoded on Twitch üí¨‚ú®

As mentioned in last month‚Äôs communications, our founder Ms Boba will be
streaming only once a week (instead of twice a week) for the foreseeable future.
There‚Äôs always a chance of an unscheduled bonus stream, so keep an eye on either
your Twitch notifications, our social media feeds, or on Ms Boba‚Äôs permanent

Here‚Äôs the schedule for upcoming Twitch streams‚Äîwhile we have some work
tentatively scheduled, for the most part you‚Äôll just get to hang out with Ms
Boba as she works on campaign fulfillment stuff and other company needs. This
month, the bulk of the work will be the Issue 1 preview and digital rewards
fulfilments, so if you‚Äôre curious about those come on in!
