Good news, fujoshi fudanshi fujin and friends! We didn’t get swindled—we got
invited to speak at a con!

relief and slumps in his chair as a crowd of Thermians applaud
him.](galaxyquest-phew.gif)

Well, specifically, _our founder Ms Boba_ got invited, but she’ll be
representing FujoCoded LLC when she gives her talk 👍

We here at FujoCoded LLC often reflect on the importance of community and how
grateful we are for your interest and support. Despite the huge number of people
on the internet, it’s surprisingly easy to feel alone. That’s why we’re so
psyched for **[CitrusCon](https://www.citruscon.com/)**, a **free** virtual 18+
convention for lovers of BL, queer media, and fandom as a whole. The event is
meant to bring together the usual suspects of fujoshi, fudanshi, fujin, and
friends, so how could we not love it?

The con (and Ms Boba’s talk!) is coming up NEXT WEEK, so make sure to check out
the bottom of this post for more details.

## Recent Progress on our BackerKit Campaign

**Fulfillment Survey Filled:** Most of you managed to fill out our survey. For
the 14 that didn’t, see us after class 😉 (that is…email us at
[contacts@fujocoded.com](mailto:contacts@fujocoded.com) if you have questions). That’s enough for us to move
forward ordering all our incredible BackerKit rewards. Backers’ credit cards
have been charged, and with the resulting funds, we have placed the necessary
orders. All physical rewards are in production!

Ha…Yes!” design with Boba-tan pressing her face to a window, while the black
shirt has a bright yellow FujoCoded logo.](fujoshirts.jpg) _Shirt samples!_

![A stack of laser-cut cheese boards. The bottom of the stack is five large
“hime”-sized boards. On top of those are two stacks of eight “chibi”-sized
boards. The two visible chibi boards say Yuri and Fujoshi.](fujoboardsStack.jpg)

prints’ size.](printsWithMug.jpg) _Our prints! Mug for scale._

**“Behind the Scenes” Behind the Scenes:** The FujoCoded team all pitched in to
prepare the “Behind the Scenes” files documenting the birth of the Fujoshi Guide
to Web Development—even the team member with a newborn baby (👼) volunteered her
time! Together we made sure these image-heavy brainstorming documents had
contributor credits, image sources, alt text, and an introduction to put
everything in context. Now when the Digital Goodies Pack goes live, these pieces
of FujoGuide’s history will be fully accessible to all our campaign backers. Go
team!

**Finally Legal:** We got engaged 💍 This is fancy legal speak to say that we
have officially contracted an IP lawyer to do the special contract legalese for
us. We are waiting to hear back on a cost estimate, which will determine whether
we can move forward on our two top priorities—freelance writer contracts and
character design rights—sequentially or simultaneously. Both of these items are
critical to helping us produce the high-level communal shitposting we aspire to,
while still protecting both our rights and those of the creatives we work with.

**Patronage Power-ups:** In preparation for our upcoming appearance at
CitrusCon, we're working on making it possible for our supporters to directly
support FujoCoded on an ongoing basis. To that end, we’re working on two
different ways people can give us money!

- **Merch sales:** We're deep into coding our online store, making decisions
  about which features are part of the minimum viable product and which can wait
  for later updates
- **Patreon Swap:** We're reworking our founder Ms Boba’s [Patreon and
  self-hosted $upporters
  newsletter](https://www.patreon.com/essentialrandomness) to be FujoCoded's
  instead of Ms Boba's. This means changing not only the branding, but the bank
  accounts the money is deposited in, what the reward tiers look like, and so
  on. Things will look mostly the same for a while longer, but change is taking
  place behind the scenes😉

**Cheque it out:** Recurring expenses related to FujoCoded LLC, like web hosting
and corporate registration, are being transferred one at a time from getting
paid by our founder’s old business account to getting paid out from the
abovementioned company bank account. Look ma, I’m a real boy!

## What’s Next for the FujoCoded BackerKit

**Digital Goodies PACKED:** You'll receive your digital goodies pack as soon as
we start shipping out physical rewards and figure out digital rewards
distribution on BackerKit. If you like the digital goodies you receive, consider
subscribing to [our Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/essentialrandomness)—future
digital goodies will be distributed to our regular supporters!

**IP Contracts:** Now that we've finally secured the help of an IP lawyer, we
can finally move forward with upgrading our previous agreement with character
designers and laying the groundwork for proper legal contracts. As you can
imagine, it’s a lot cheaper for a lawyer to edit an existing draft than to write
something from scratch. This is why our new lawyer suggested we lay some of the
groundwork ourselves. See **Volunteer Opportunity - Legal Research** below if
you want to help!

**IRL Shipping:** Once we have the goods in hand, we can move on to the next
stage: shipping them out to all of our lovely backers. We’re still waiting for
some must-have items to arrive, but we hope to start shipping before the monthly
update is out!

**Becoming Ungovernable:** We need to look into the legal options for an LLC
with a sociocratic structure instead of a hierarchical board-of-directors
structure. We’ve assembled some example LLC membership agreements from other
sociocratic companies and will be reviewing them in order to design one that
works for FujoCoded LLC.

## Talk to us 🔊

**Volunteer Opportunity - Legal Research:** As we mentioned last month, we're
looking for volunteers ready to brave legal language and documents to create the
initial drafts of our contributor contracts by piecing together existing
templates. Help us complete our prep work and move forward with IP rights
agreements for our character designers, illustrators, and writers! No formal
legal experience or license required (although appreciated): all contracts will
be extensively reviewed by paid legal professionals before being put into use!

We didn’t get any candidates volunteering last month, but it probably would’ve
helped to have included contact information with the request. If you’re
interested, get in touch at [contacts@fujocoded.com](mailto:contacts@fujocoded.com) 😅

## Recent Progress on the Fujoshi Guide to Web Development

**Vol. 0, Issue 1 Resource Page:** Our all-important “Before You Start” section
is done, which provides the complete list of all the prerequisite skills our
readers will need to get the most out of Vol. 0, Issue 1: Git. And what kind of
guide would the FujoGuide be if it didn’t give you a way to pick up its prereqs?
Accordingly, the Issue 1 resource page now offers four Quick Start articles…

- Terminal Basics
- Terminal Navigation
- Installing Git
- Git Settings

…with a few more articles (like our quick overview of editing HTML and CSS
files) nearing completion. In addition to featuring on the Issue 1 Resource
Page, these articles will be available through the public-facing section of our
educational site, where they will help us in our long-term goal of providing
accessible web development education for the everyday fujin.

**Issue Styling:** Our founder Ms Boba did a livestream showing off more
zine-building in action. The issue is looking more kawaii than ever! If you
missed out, you can catch the archived version of the stream
[here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2216821006). Another great chance to see how
the sausage gets made!

**Digital Goodies Pack:** We commissioned a unique badge _exclusively_ for our
FujoGuide Kickstarter Backers. A unique badge was the cherry on top of the
digital goodies pack for our FujoCoded BackerKit campaign; we saw how much
people loved that one and felt we should give our FujoGuide backers their very
own. You deserve it 🥰

And with that, our digital goodies pack will be complete! As previously
mentioned, you’ll receive it at the same time as our FujoCoded BackerKit backers
do—we’re all one big happy FujoVerse family 🤗

## What's Next for FujoGuide

**Multishipping:** It was overwhelmingly clear from the survey result that most
people either didn't care or wanted everything in one shipment. The general
feeling was “please do whatever is easier for you without stressing your
contributors.” We're very grateful, and in accordance with your responses we're
shelving our plan to ship the first issue on its own. We might revisit this
choice (and maybe ask again) as the rest of the issues shape up.

**Soooo close:** We have a bit more styling and one last typo review before we
can send the digital preview version to backers. Lastly, we’ll make the file(s)
downloadable…and then it’ll be yours!

## Around the FujoVerse

### We're Going to CitrusCon!

[CitrusCon](https://www.citruscon.com/) is a free virtual 18+ convention
dedicated to BL, queer media, and all things fandom that will take place August
23-25. As you saw in the introduction, our founder Ms Boba has been
[invited](https://www.citruscon.com/guests-2024/ms-bobafujocoded) as a speaker!
This is a great opportunity for more like-minded fujoshi and friends to learn
about FujoCoded LLC, the Fujoshi Guide to Web Development, and BobaBoard.
Consequently, we decided it was worth it to temporarily divert some of our
organizational resources (namely: Ms Boba’s time and energy) to CitrusCon prep.

The talk itself is slated for 6-7 PM EDT ([see timezone
converter](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?qm=1&lid=5378538,5419384,4273837,5128581,2643743,2988507,1261481,1819729,1850147,2147714&h=5128581&date=2024-8-23&sln=18.5-19.5&hf=1))
on Friday, August 23, 2024. Here’s the writeup:

> **Title: Rebuilding Community on the (fujo)Web**  
> Abstract: It's hard to agree about anything on today's internet... except that
> it isn't the place it used to be! In this talk, we will explore the erosion of
> community on the modern web and the challenges in the way of building a more
> user-centered online ecosystem.

To attend, all you need to do is [register](https://www.citruscon.com/attend)
(for free!) by August 22. We’ll also be sending a more in-depth announcement
about the planned talk in a standalone update soon after this post goes up. Hope
to see some of you in the audience!

### Hang Out with FujoCoded Live on Twitch 💬✨

Because our founder Ms Boba will be speaking at CitrusCon at the end of next
week, she’s forgoing her weekly stream to focus on psyching herself up for a
public speaking engagement. [Weekly

If you missed the August 15th stream, you can catch it archived
