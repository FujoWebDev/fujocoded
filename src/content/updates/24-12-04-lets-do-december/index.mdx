Fujoshi, fudanshi, fujin, and friends,  

We thought so long and hard about how to react to the US election that we reset
our entire update schedule: from now on, you can expect these updates at the
beginning of the month instead of the middle!

What we most want to say is that **now more than ever, we believe in the
importance of&nbsp; our mission**: to empower fujoshi and other online
countercultures to shape their respective corners of the web, to teach
marginalized web users the tools of community organizing and technological
rebellion, and to fuel the larger movement towards a free and decentralized
internet.

No matter what the future throws at us over the next four years and beyond, **the
fight for a kinder, weirder internet must not stop.** We're glad you're with us on
this journey, and we hope you'll commit during the upcoming holidays to stake a
claim of your own on your online world, whether that's making your own
[NeoCities](https://neocities.org/) fan page, [learning to use a
terminal](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/quickstarts/terminal-quickstart/), writing
your first TamperMonkey script, [volunteering with us](#you-can-help), or pitching in with a
different community project.&nbsp;

You have more power than you know ðŸ’›

## Company Credit

- **Nudging the Newsletter:** As mentioned above, we're sending this at the
  beginning of the month, rather than in the middle. This is because we've
  decided to shift our schedule going forward, which makes this the last
  newsletter of the year! From our team to all of you, happy holidays and thank
  you for your support throughout 2024 and beyond ðŸŽ‡
- **A January Escapade:** In January, we're heading to Los Angeles to table and
  mingle at EscapadeCon! We'll skip our usual in-depth newsletter that month, so
  the next time you get a normal newsletter will be the beginning of February.
  Come get your news in person at one of the oldest slash conventions out there
  (it's been going since 1991!). You can buy tickets [on their
  website](https://escapadecon.net/)â€”they even [offer
  scholarships](https://escapadecon.net/scholarship/)!&nbsp;
- **FujoSky:** BlueSky offers a similar user experience to Twitter, but it also
  offers a bunch of fun customization opportunities under the hood. Come hang
  out with us on stream, we're building AtProto-based tools to learn how it
  works. We've been making custom labelers:&nbsp;
  
  - Labeler 1: [What type of fujin are
    you?](https://bsky.app/profile/fujinlabeler.bsky.social) 
  - Labeler 2: [Give your BlueSky account an AO3 rating
    tag!](https://bsky.app/profile/ao3labeler.bsky.social) 
  - Labeler 3 (work in progress): [Posting fanwork? Label it by type! Looking
    for fanworks? Follow feeds by
    type!](https://bsky.app/profile/fanworkslabels.bsky.social)

## Recent Progress on our BackerKit Campaign

- **That Ship Has Sailed:** All physical BackerKit campaign rewards have
  officially been shipped! When you get your rewards, please consider posting
  them on social media and tagging us ðŸ˜Ž If you haven't received a shipping
  notification yet, let us know at
  [contacts@fujocoded.com](mailto:contacts@fujocoded.com)!
- **_hacker voice_ "You're in":** 20% off store discount codes have been shipped
  to all our eligible BackerKit backers. Thanks for your supportâ€”hope you enjoy
  the stuff in the store you helped us finance!
- **Article Physics:** One of our stretch goals was raising funds for an article
  on the Javascript package manager NPM. Here's the progress we've made so
  far:&nbsp;
  
  - Our founder Ms Boba talked with NPM beginners to get a sense of the
    information they needed the most, then dumped all her observations into a
    single document with a draft of a potential outline. We've also recruited
    another volunteer to finalize this outline and prepare it for our future
    tech writer!
  - Long-time BobaBoard volunteer and core FujoCoded supporter **enigmalea** has
    been [selected](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/selection-process/) as the
    lead of the BobaBoard/FujoVerse [Documentation
    Bubble](https://docs.bobaboard.com/docs/volunteering/community/our-bubbles).
    They're putting together a team that (among other things) will:
    
    - Research license options for the articles we're planning to commission
    - Work with our legal recruit ([introduced in
      October](https://fujocoded.com/updates/24-09-19-updates-getting-long#whats-next-for-the-fujocoded-backerkit))
      to finish drafting tech writer contracts for both BobaBoard and the rest
      of the FujoVerse projects
    - Draft work requirements for prospective tech writers&nbsp;&nbsp;
  - BobaBoard volunteer and FujoCoded supporter **Dove** has been
    [selected](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/selection-process/) as lead of
    the BobaBoard/FujoVerse [Volunteering
    Bubble](https://docs.bobaboard.com/docs/volunteering/community/our-bubbles).
    She's putting together a team that (among other things) will:
    
    - Finalize work requirements for prospective tech writers&nbsp;
    - Publicize our need for a tech writer and make job postings
- **(Article Physics, con'td):** It's been really great to watch more of the
  BobaBoard organization take shape in a way that will continue to empower the
  FujoVerse to get things done even after this specific campaign has wrapped.

## What's Next for the FujoCoded BackerKit

- **Blowing Bubbles:** We'll be using the coming month of December to have the
  first meetings of the Documentation and Volunteering bubbles (see above).
- **Cons & Contracts:** While much of our focus in January will be on our con
  appearance at Escapade, our other focus will be collaborating with the
  Documentation bubble on wrapping up our own contract efforts and getting them
  approved by our lawyer.
- **Budge(t) up:** With all the production and shipping complete, we can now
  accurately determine exactly how much money we have left to pay article
  writers.
- **It's drafty in here:** We'll continue revising the draft outline of the NPM
  article based on the research our founder Ms Boba put together with the help
  of fannish NPM beginners. The clearer our draft is, the better our tech writer
  will do!
- **THE END IS NIGH:** With the digital and physical rewards distributed, we're
  well on our way toward wrapping up campaign fulfillment. All that's missing
  are the articles and the legal contracts we need to get them done! ðŸ˜Œ

## Recent Progress on the Fujoshi Guide to Web Development

- **Results are (partially) in**: As you know, we delivered the digital preview
  version of **Vol. 0, Issue 1: Git**! The feedback we've received so far has
  been incredibly positive, which has been incredibly validating! We're glad our
  hard work is resonating with readers! However, the number of people leaving
  any feedback whatsoever is still pretty low. If you have time, even just to
  give your brief first impression of the beginning of the issue, we would
  _really_ appreciate it!
  
  - The email that delivered the digital issue files was called **Project Update
    #45: The Fujoshi Guide to Web Development by Essential Randomness** if you
    need to dig it up in your inbox.
  - [You can leave feedback on the digital issue
    here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdhVpCtRttve5YRTxhcxgiccIlqYdeMV2Xo53Vv92G89c5t8A/viewform).
  - Here's some examples of great feedback from social media:
    
    - [On
      tumblr](https://fujowebdev.tumblr.com/post/767897452251660288/aaaahhh-you-have-no-idea-how-happy-this-feedback)
    - [On twitter](https://x.com/_featherweather/status/1851015335807181185)
    - [On mastodon](https://blorbo.social/@Beebz@aethy.com/113415294483054243)
- **Webbed site:** A vital accessory to the digital preview of **Vol. 0, Issue
  1: Git** is [our companion site](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/), where we catch
  you up on how to use a Terminal, how to edit HTML and CSS files, and&nbsp; how
  to install Git in the first place. We're very proud of the site, but we're
  sure it could be even better. That's why we need your feedback! If you need
  some distraction from the chaos of the holidays or want to gift yourself the
  pleasure of learning something new,check out the companion site and then [let
  us know what you think](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/feedback).
- **Gateway drug:** Don't know where to start? We think going through [the
  terminal article](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/quickstarts/terminal-quickstart/)
  is a great first step for people who aren't ready for the full guide but want
  to take ONE action that will set them up for long-term success.

## What's Next for FujoGuide

- **Fujo (Hiber)Nation:** It's vitally important that we get as much reader
  feedback as possible on Issue 1 before we make any major progress on Issues 2
  & 3. And getting the digital issue out was a lot of work, so we think we've
  earned a bit of a holiday! Accordingly, we're holding off on news about future
  issues until the beginning of February. In the meantime:
  
  - Read **Vol. 0, Issue 1: Git**!!!
  - [Give us feedback on Issue
    1](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdhVpCtRttve5YRTxhcxgiccIlqYdeMV2Xo53Vv92G89c5t8A/viewform)
    and [on the Companion Site](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/feedback)!
  - If you can't find the time to read the issue, start with reading the
    [Terminal article
    on](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/quickstarts/terminal-quickstart/)
    [learn.fujoweb.dev](http://learn.fujoweb.dev). As mentioned above, it's a
    great first step for people who aren't ready for the full guide but want to
    take ONE action that will set them up for long-term success.

## Around the FujoVerse

### **Escaping to Escapade**

We're heading down to Los Angeles to table at EscapadeCon from January 31 to
February 2. Escapade bills itself as a "slash slumber party" and has been a
celebration of fujoshi, fudanshi, fujin, and friends since way back in 1991,
which means it's exactly the right crowd to introduce to the Fujoverse. Both our
founder Ms Boba and our communications manager Dove will be there selling merch
and preaching the good word about the Fujoshi Guide to Web Development,
FujoCoded, and the rest of the FujoVerse.&nbsp;

You can buy tickets [here on their website](https://escapadecon.net/)â€”and if
your budget is tight, they [offer
scholarships](https://escapadecon.net/scholarship/)!

## You can help!

We're putting together a group of volunteers to assist with revamping
[BobaBoard.com](http://BobaBoard.com) (the static home page for BobaBoard, not
the social media platform called BobaBoard) and
[docs.bobaboard.com](http://docs.bobaboard.com) (the repository of articles
about every different part of BobaBoard.) Here's the kind of help we could use:

- **Nitpickers (for BobaBoard):** Volunteers to give feedback on the BobaBoard
  home page, help us identify things that are outdated or confusing, catch
  typos, and find broken links. All you need to bring to the table is your
  opinion!
- **Astro coders (for BobaBoard):** Know the Astro framework, or [willing to
  learn](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhXpCwgI-5FIo4KHBNSsrGi78pLECCe7Z)?
  The revamp of these sites will involve moving from React-based frameworks
  (NextJS, Docusaurus) to Astro (and its documentation framework, Starlight)!
  This is a great chance to gain some relatively entry-level experience with one
  of our favorite technologies to build personal websites with and learn more
  about frameworks.
- **Copywriters, UI/UX folks, and/or web designers** **(for BobaBoard)**: After
  we move everything to Astro, we'll need to rewrite, redesign, or rebuild the
  outdated parts of the home page. Whether you have decades of experience or
  just a hobbyist level of interest, we'd love to have you.

If you'd like to try any of these roles, or if you'd like to get involved in
other ways, let us know via
[contacts@fujocoded.com](mailto:contacts@fujocoded.com).

## That's all, folks!

We hope you're enjoying the annual holiday store discount, and we wish you all
the best during this holiday season. May the winter-themed fanfic featuring your
faves be plentiful!

Warmest wishes,

The FujoCoded LLC Team
