Greetings, fujoshi, fudanshi, fujin, and friends,  
We might not have reached the anniversary of _you all finding out_ yet, but the
paperwork does not lie: **it’s now been a year since our company was formed\!** We
are—once more with gusto\!—incredibly grateful for all your help carrying us to
this milestone, and proud of all we have achieved until now.

To many more years of business, fun, coding, and above all… fujo’ing out with
friends\!
