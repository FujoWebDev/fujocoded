- **Coding Transitions:** As you might know, Fandom Coders will be our next
  project to graduate—that is, become its own sociocratic community led by its
  own members. This month, we’ve reviewed all applications and put together a
  team of members to carry out the transition and figure out all the next steps…
  together\!
- **FujoLounge:** We’re now ready to put Real Subscriber Data® into our
  database, after which we’ll be able to start testing our $upporters-only

  extra treat for those who contribute to our cause with [their Patreon
  support](https://www.patreon.com/fujocoded).
