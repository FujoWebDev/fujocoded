#### FujoCoded BackerKit Fulfillment Progress: Recent

- **New Outlines:** We‚Äôre getting ready to tackle our first ‚Äúhired gig‚Äù for a
  [learn.fujoweb.dev](http://learn.fujoweb.dev) article: our introductory(ish)
  guide to JavaScript development with NPM. One step we took this month: our
  outline for the article is ready, and we shared it with a few chosen friends
  for initial feedback.
- **New _New Outlines_:** The next article in our pipeline of rewards is about
  handling those _crucial confrontations_ that arise when people tackle
  ambitious goals together (like ours)\! After reading through [the
  book](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Confrontations-Resolving-Promises-Expectations/dp/0071446524),
  our comms lead Dove has brainstormed ways to condense and adapt the advice to
  fandom‚Äôs needs. (Sounds like you could have used that advice? Read the next
  section for ways to help\!)
- **Baby‚Äôs First Contract:** We got our first artist contract officially
  signed\! The legal ducks dance happily in their row ü¶Üü¶Üü¶Ü

#### FujoCoded BackerKit Fulfillment Progress: Future

- **Baby‚Äôs First Writer:** Once we‚Äôre done gathering all the feedback, we‚Äôll
  face an important choice: should we spend more time brainstorming, or are we
  ready to throw ourselves into _hiring our first writer_? Look out for the
  answer (and a potential call for resumes) next month\!
- **Trust Relationships:** To fully land our article on conflict, we want to do
  some ‚Äúmarket research‚Äù and learn more about how confronting (or being
  confronted by) fellow fans has gone for our audience.

  Relevant experiences include:

  - Contributors backing out of fanwork commitments during events/exchanges
  - Organizers of fandom events, fandom servers, etc., struggling to delegate
    responsibility for getting things done or follow up on unfinished delegated
    tasks
  - Moderators confronting server members or event participants over their
    conduct
  - Beta reader arrangements gone sideways
  - Any situation in which a fandom commitment was dropped with little or no
    warning

  If you have experience with any sort of fandom confrontation like this, or a
  fandom confrontation that really needed to happen but _didn‚Äôt_, then Dove
  would love to talk to you\! Please reach out to
  [info@fujocoded.com](mailto:info@fujocoded.com) to get in touch.
