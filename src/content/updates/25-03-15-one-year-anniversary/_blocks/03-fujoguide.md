## Recent Progress on the Fujoshi Guide to Web Development

- **Alphas Become Betas:** We scheduled our beta reading for “FujoGuide Issue 2:
  GitHub”. If everything goes as planned (🤞) **it will happen in early May\!**
- **Feeding Feedback:** It’s not yet time to release “FujoGuide Issue 1: Git” to
  the wider public, but rest assured: we’re finding this launch a sweet spot in
  our busy schedule\! In the meantime… have we asked you for _feedback_ yet?
  Whether [for the
  zine](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hUpZw-Jm0Q9zJddwFqGK-k141tHwl4mLU05ttiucel8/edit),

  make sure to make your voice heard\!

## What’s Next for FujoGuide

- **Better Beta:** Now that the second trial for “FujoGuide Issue 2: GitHub” is
  scheduled, it is time to tame the unruly alpha into a much more orderly beta.
  Between now and May, Ms Boba will work to get the catboy polished and ready
  for showtime.
- **Are We There Yet?:** As we mentioned, we’re currently looking into how to
  schedule the official release of “Issue 1: Git, Preview Edition”. We have
  quite a few things planned for the coming months, so we’ll be looking for the
  right occasion to let more people get their paws on it\!
