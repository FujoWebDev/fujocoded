## Around the FujoVerse

### In the press

- **Talkin‚Äô Ship:** This year, Ms Boba is going to present at not one, but TWO
  conferences (so far\!). Not only will she be speaking at [Citrus
  Con](https://www.citruscon.com/) in June, but she‚Äôll be giving an updated
  version of her talk about fandom and Open Protocols at the [ATmosphere
  conference](https://atprotocol.dev/atmosphereconf/), the first conference
  about ATProto, the protocol behind social apps like Bluesky.
- **Technically Committed:** Speaking of ATProto, Ms Boba is now officially a
  member of the Technical Steering Committee for the [‚Äúcommunity Lexicons‚Äù
  initiative](https://github.com/lexicon-community). As part of her role, she‚Äôll
  be helping define community-led practices and data types for social apps built
  on ATProto. She‚Äôs also bringing some of our sociocracy practices into the
  mix\!
- **Private Talk:** During the ATmosphere conference, there‚Äôs going to be a lot
  of talking all around. Developers from across the web will be meeting up to
  discuss and gather feedback on many different topics that are relevant to the
  future of independent socials. The Bluesky team will also be gathering
  feedback and discussing use cases for their upcoming work on private data.
  While she doesn‚Äôt promise, Ms Boba _might_ send out updates on [her own
  Bluesky account](https://bsky.app/profile/essentialrandom.bsky.social).

## FujoStore Highlights: Restocks, Sales, and Limited-Time Offers

## You can help\!

This month, we‚Äôre looking for some meta-help‚Ä¶ with _this very newsletter\!_ Read
below for this opportunity and more:

- **Newsletter Writer (üí∞):** Do you know how to engage an audience? Do you have
  a penchant for writing cursed puns? Do you want some behind-the-scenes deets
  on all we‚Äôre up to? We‚Äôre looking to hire a newsletter writer\! Whether you‚Äôre
  a hobbyist seeking a challenge or a professional writer seeking an
  itty-bitty-hyper-tiny gig as an enrichment activity, whether English is your
  native language or "fanfictions taught you well", get in touch with us if
  you‚Äôd like to, well, _take my job_.
- **Fannish Conflict Advisors:** We‚Äôre looking for people willing to tell us
  more about how confronting (or being confronted by) fellow fans has gone in
  critical moments\! If you organize fannish events and are struggling to
  delegate, or if you struggled with zine participants backing out during
  events/exchanges, or you have experience with these sorts of fandom
  confrontations that either happened or _needed_ to happen (but didn‚Äôt), hit us
  up\!
- **Permanent Call for Artists:** A few people asked if they could submit their
  art resume even ‚Äúoff season‚Äù. The answer is yes: we always welcome artists
  dropping their contacts in our [Artist Business Card Drop-Off
  form](https://forms.gle/bvUhPTdxM6nUGwAYA). We will ask around for specific
  qualifications when actively looking, but we always source from our whole
  roster of friends and friends-to-be\!

If you‚Äôd like to help us with our newsletter, want to air your fannish
confrontation grievances with us, or if you‚Äôd like to get involved in other
ways, please let us know at
[contacts@fujocoded.com](mailto:contacts@fujocoded.com). Or, if you‚Äôre an
artist, use our [Artist Business Card Drop-Off
form](https://forms.gle/bvUhPTdxM6nUGwAYA). .
