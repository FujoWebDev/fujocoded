You Can Help!
This month, we’re looking for some meta-help… with this very newsletter! Read below for this opportunity and more:

Newsletter Writer (💰): Do you know how to engage an audience? Do you have a penchant for writing cursed puns? Do you want some behind-the-scenes deets on all we’re up to? We’re looking to hire a newsletter writer! Whether you’re a hobbyist seeking a challenge or a professional writer seeking an itty-bitty-hyper-tiny gig as an enrichment activity, whether English is your native language or “fanfictions taught you well”, get in touch with us if you’d like to, well, take my job.
Fannish Conflict Advisors: We’re looking for people willing to tell us more about how confronting (or being confronted by) fellow fans has gone in critical moments! If you organize fannish events and are struggling to delegate, or if you struggled with zine participants backing out during events/exchanges, or you have experience with these sorts of fandom confrontations that either happened or needed to happen (but didn’t), hit us up!
Permanent Call for Artists: A few people asked if they could submit their art resume even “off season”. The answer is yes: we always welcome artists dropping their contacts in our Artist Business Card Drop-Off form. We will ask around for specific qualifications when actively looking, but we always source from our whole roster of friends and friends-to-be!
If you’d like to help us with our newsletter, want to air your fannish confrontation grievances with us, or if you’d like to get involved in other ways, please let us know at contacts@fujocoded.com. Or, if you’re an artist, use our Artist Business Card Drop-Off form.
