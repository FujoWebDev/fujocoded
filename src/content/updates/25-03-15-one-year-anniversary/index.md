Greetings, fujoshi, fudanshi, fujin, and friends,  
We might not have reached the anniversary of _you all finding out_ yet, but the
paperwork does not lie: it‚Äôs now been a year since our company was formed\! We
are‚Äîonce more with gusto\!‚Äîincredibly grateful for all your help carrying us to
this milestone, and proud of all we have achieved until now.

To many more years of business, fun, coding, and above all‚Ä¶ fujo‚Äôing out with
friends\!

### FujoCoded

#### FujoCoded General Company News

- **Baby‚Äôs First Year:** What more is there to say? Happy birthday, FujoCoded\!
  üçº
- **Coding Transitions:** As you might know, Fandom Coders will be our next
  project to graduate‚Äîthat is, become its own sociocratic community led by its
  own members. This month, we‚Äôve reviewed all applications and put together a
  team of members to carry out the transition and figure out all the next steps‚Ä¶
  together\!
- **FujoLounge:** We‚Äôre now ready to put Real Subscriber Data¬Æ into our
  database, after which we‚Äôll be able to start testing our $upporters-only
  portal. March is always our busiest month (üëÄ), but we hope to soon have an
  extra treat for those who contribute to our cause with [their Patreon
  support](https://www.patreon.com/fujocoded).
- **Speaking Up:** This will be a busy year for speaking engagements. Not only
  has Ms Boba been invited again to speak at [Citrus
  Con](https://www.citruscon.com/) (June 20th‚Äì22nd), she‚Äôll also be an official
  speaker at the first [ATmosphere
  conference](https://atprotocol.dev/atmosphereconf/) next week\! Read below for
  a few more details\!
- **April‚Äôs Wise:** At this point, we know you know: our yearly April 1st event
  draws near‚Ä¶ What will it be? Well, it‚Äôs a surprise\! Fortunately, a _sweet_,
  _sweet_ surprise.

#### FujoCoded BackerKit Fulfillment Progress: Recent

- **New Outlines:** We‚Äôre getting ready to tackle our first ‚Äúhired gig‚Äù for a
  [learn.fujoweb.dev](http://learn.fujoweb.dev) article: our introductory(ish)
  guide to JavaScript development with NPM. One step we took this month: our
  outline for the article is ready, and we shared it with a few chosen friends
  for initial feedback.
- **New _New Outlines_:** The next article in our pipeline of rewards is about
  handling those _crucial confrontations_ that arise when people tackle
  ambitious goals together (like ours)\! After reading through [the
  book](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Confrontations-Resolving-Promises-Expectations/dp/0071446524),
  our comms lead Dove has brainstormed ways to condense and adapt the advice to
  fandom‚Äôs needs. (Sounds like you could have used that advice? Read the next
  section for ways to help\!)
- **Baby‚Äôs First Contract:** We got our first artist contract officially
  signed\! The legal ducks dance happily in their row ü¶Üü¶Üü¶Ü

#### FujoCoded BackerKit Fulfillment Progress: Future

- **Baby‚Äôs First Writer:** Once we‚Äôre done gathering all the feedback, we‚Äôll
  face an important choice: should we spend more time brainstorming, or are we
  ready to throw ourselves into _hiring our first writer_? Look out for the
  answer (and a potential call for resumes) next month\!
- **Trust Relationships:** To fully land our article on conflict, we want to do
  some ‚Äúmarket research‚Äù and learn more about how confronting (or being
  confronted by) fellow fans has gone for our audience.

  Relevant experiences include:

  - Contributors backing out of fanwork commitments during events/exchanges
  - Organizers of fandom events, fandom servers, etc., struggling to delegate
    responsibility for getting things done or follow up on unfinished delegated
    tasks
  - Moderators confronting server members or event participants over their
    conduct
  - Beta reader arrangements gone sideways
  - Any situation in which a fandom commitment was dropped with little or no
    warning

  If you have experience with any sort of fandom confrontation like this, or a
  fandom confrontation that really needed to happen but _didn‚Äôt_, then Dove
  would love to talk to you\! Please reach out to
  [info@fujocoded.com](mailto:info@fujocoded.com) to get in touch.

### FujoGuide

#### FujoGuide Kickstarter Fulfillment Progress: Recent

- **Alphas Become Betas:** We scheduled our beta reading for ‚ÄúFujoGuide Issue 2:
  GitHub‚Äù. If everything goes as planned (ü§û) it will happen in early May\!
- **Feeding Feedback:** It‚Äôs not yet time to release ‚ÄúFujoGuide Issue 1: Git‚Äù to
  the wider public, but rest assured: we‚Äôre finding this launch a sweet spot in
  our busy schedule\! In the meantime‚Ä¶ have we asked you for _feedback_ yet?
  Whether [for the
  zine](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hUpZw-Jm0Q9zJddwFqGK-k141tHwl4mLU05ttiucel8/edit),
  or the [learning
  site](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScDr4p8CQp0iDh0HgLL8DfCdLQLXyKWX30ElChUGxlAtGXWaA/viewform),
  make sure to make your voice heard\!

#### FujoGuide Kickstarter Fulfillment Progress: Future

- **Better Beta:** Now that the second trial for ‚ÄúFujoGuide Issue 2: GitHub‚Äù is
  scheduled, it is time to tame the unruly alpha into a much more orderly beta.
  Between now and May, Ms Boba will work to get the catboy polished and ready
  for showtime.
- **Are We There Yet?:** As we mentioned, we‚Äôre currently looking into how to
  schedule the official release of ‚ÄúIssue 1: Git, Preview Edition‚Äù. We have
  quite a few things planned for the coming months, so we‚Äôll be looking for the
  right occasion to let more people get their paws on it\!

### Around the FujoVerse

#### In the press

- **Talkin‚Äô Ship:** This year, Ms Boba is going to present at not one, but TWO
  conferences (so far\!). Not only will she be speaking at Citrus Con in June,
  but she‚Äôll be giving an updated version of her talk about fandom and Open
  Protocols at the ATmosphere conference, the first conference about ATProto,
  the protocol behind social apps like Bluesky.
- **Technically Committed:** Speaking of ATProto, Ms Boba is now officially a
  member of the Technical Steering Committee for the ‚Äúcommunity Lexicons‚Äù
  initiative. As part of her role, she‚Äôll be helping define community-led
  practices and data types for social apps built on ATProto. She‚Äôs also bringing
  some of our sociocracy practices into the mix\!
- **Private Talk:** During the ATmosphere conference, there‚Äôs going to be a lot
  of talking all around. Developers from across the web will be meeting up to
  discuss and gather feedback on many different topics that are relevant to the
  future of independent socials. The Bluesky team will also be gathering
  feedback and discussing use cases for their upcoming work on private data.
  While she doesn‚Äôt promise, Ms Boba _might_ send out updates on her own Bluesky
  account.

#### Ms Boba Streaming Schedule

Given the busy month(s) ahead, we don‚Äôt have a streaming schedule this time. Ms
Boba will try to do some work in public some Mondays and Thursdays at 3PM
Pacific, so be sure to follow her on
[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/essentialrandomness) to get notified when she
goes online\!

### FujoStore Highlights: Restocks, Sales, and Limited-Time Offers

We don‚Äôt have any specials for you this month, but we have a very _special_
month ahead. Keep an eye on this space and our socials for an upcoming
limited-edition offer you surely won‚Äôt want to miss.

### You can help\!

This month, we‚Äôre looking for some meta-help‚Ä¶ with _this very newsletter\!_ Read
below for this opportunity and more:

- **Lettering News (üí∞):** Do you know how to engage an audience? Do you have a
  penchant for writing cursed puns? Do you want some behind-the-scenes deets on
  all we‚Äôre up to? We‚Äôre looking to hire a newsletter writer\! Whether you‚Äôre a
  hobbyist seeking a challenge or a professional writer seeking an
  itty-bitty-hyper-tiny gig as an enrichment activity, get in touch with us if
  you‚Äôd like to, well, _take my job_.
- **Trust Relationships:** We‚Äôre looking for people willing to tell us more
  about how confronting (or being confronted by) fellow fans has gone in
  critical moments\! If you organize fannish events and are struggling to
  delegate, or if you struggled with zine participants backing out during
  events/exchanges, or you have experience with these sorts of fandom
  confrontations that either happened or _needed_ to happen (but didn‚Äôt), hit us
  up\!
- **Art Permanency:** A few people asked if they could submit their art resume
  even ‚Äúoff season‚Äù. The answer is yes: we always welcome artists dropping their
  contacts in our [Artist Business Card Drop-Off
  form](https://forms.gle/bvUhPTdxM6nUGwAYA). We might ask around for specific
  qualifications when actively looking, but we always source from our whole
  roster of friends and friends-to-be\!

If you‚Äôd like to help us with our newsletter, want to air your fannish
confrontation grievances with us, or if you‚Äôd like to get involved in other
ways, please let us know via contacts@fujocoded.com. Or, if you‚Äôre an artist,
use our artist business card dropoff.

### That‚Äôs All, Folks\!

And with this‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre done for this month\! See you on-the-day-you-expect for our
April 1st sorta-surprise\!

Love,  
The FujoCoded Team
