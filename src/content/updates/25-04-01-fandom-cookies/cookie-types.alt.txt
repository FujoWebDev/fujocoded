Screenshot of the Fandom Cookies shop. Shop Cookies - Limited Time Offer. At the top is Boba-tan absconding with two fortune cookies in hand, held aloft as she races off with her tasty prize. Paper fortunes float in the air behind her. One might say she is running, with a cookie.

Our cookies come in 3 different flavors: kinda vanilla, for the tasteful shipper; chocolate doves for those who can take some spice; and lemony prompts for the scenario-ponderers who like their food purposeful.

Below, the three available cookie flavors. Cartoony illustrations of vanilla, chocolate, and lemon flavor fortune cookies. Each flavor is decorated with vanilla flower & beans, chocolate, or a juicy sliced lemon in the corner; there are 8 cookies to a bag. Gluten-free cookies will be 7 to a bag.

Preorder items. Currently estimated to ship late May.

Underneath is a button reading "can't take the (w)heat? Shop gluten free!".
