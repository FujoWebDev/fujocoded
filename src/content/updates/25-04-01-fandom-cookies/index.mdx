This April 1st, there's a sweet, sweet surprise in store (üòè) for you

# Introducing: FANDOM COOKIES...

...the first cookie specifically created to satiate your hunger, so you can work hard to quench your thirst!

[![Introducing Fandom Cookies: three flavors of cookies with three flavors of fortunes to match! Fandom Cookies are available in Kinda Vanilla, Chocolate Doves, and Lemony Prompts, and each have a gluten-free equivalent, too! A black & white Boba-tan logo is at the top in homage to Panda Express. This time it's Raccoon Express - Fujin Kitchen. A greyscale fortune cookie pattern sits behind the red banner. Across the center, cartoon illustrations of an assortment of traditional vanilla fortune cookies. There are some crumbs from snacking. Paper fortunes are nestled among them, but their words of wisdom must be on the reverse side and are not visible. Boba-tan lifts up a fortune cookie, her eyes closed in glee as she beams with joy. She herself is lifted up by the rush of cookies beneath her, buoyed by flavor and the power of snacks. ](./fandom-cookies.png)](https://store.fujocoded.com/fandom-cookies)

Fandom Cookies come in 3 different flavors each with its own special selection of carefully-crafted fortunes (all also in gluten free):

-  ü•† kinda vanilla, for the tasteful shipper
-  üç´ chocolate doves, for those who like spice
-  üçãlemony prompts, for the scenario-ponderers

But hurry: **They'll only be on sale until April 10th!** What are you waiting for?
