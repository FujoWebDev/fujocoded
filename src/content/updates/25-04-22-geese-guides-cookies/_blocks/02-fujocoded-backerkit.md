## Recent Progress on Our Backerkit Campaign

- **Writing Frenzy:** It’s not all geese and gobbling, we also wrote (and then rewrote ad infinitum) the outline for our soon-to-be-famous NPM article\! We might have had it (mostly) ready for the last newsletter, but Ms Boba spent some time rearranging it after a break…_and it’s now four whole articles\!_ That might stretch the budget a bit, but it’s also going to cover most of what we’ve learned the community is struggling with...just like [our already-available Terminal content](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/quickstarts/terminal-quickstart/)!
- **Village People:** Still, it takes a village to code (and learn to code) a website so we gathered a bunch of _enthusiastic feedback_ from the Fandom Coders community. We even had it reviewed by one of BobaBoard’s professional volunteer tech writers to ensure our outline sets our future hire (see below) up for success\!

## What’s Next for the FujoCoded BackerKit

- **Extended Contracts:** Our contracts are, to quote sociocracy, “good enough for now, safe enough to try”—but they’ll need a bit of extending to cover tech writers, too! And we’ll need this ASAP because…
- **Needed Prose Masters:** …we’re looking to hire a tech writer for the NPM articles with the funds raised through the [corresponding stretch goal](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/fujocoded-llc/fujocoded-software-and-education-for-a-better-web#:~:text=%245000%20%E2%80%93%C2%A0%20Closing%20the%20NPM%20Loop) in our BackerKit campaign!
