### Around the FujoVerse

#### In the press

* **Back to the Bubbles:** We’ve published the [Bobaboard retrospective](https://bobaboard.com/retro/development-logs-12)\! This is a once-a-year look back at everything our Bubbly Bubbles of BobaBoard volunteers (some of us included) have been up to. Whilst BobaBoard became our first graduated project last year (and thus moved out of the FujoCoded nest, it’s still deeply tied to us, and we’re helping each other as need be—especially when it comes to effort that benefits both of us (contracts\! Documentation\!)  
* **Bubbling to the Future:** …and just so you know, the retrospective also includes a section on [BobaBoard’s plans for 2025](https://bobaboard.com/retro/development-logs-12#our-2025-plans-sociocracy-intensifies)\! If you’re curious what we’ll be (also) up to, go check that out\!

#### Ms Boba Streaming Schedule

* **Current schedule:** With *a whole lot* happening all around, Ms Boba’s streams are (once again) on a best-effort basis\! While she’ll try to go live on Twitch **every Thursday at 3PM Pacific**, the corresponding 3PM Monday slot comes and goes. To get notified when she streams, you can subscribe to her on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/essentialrandomness), follow her on socials ([mastodon](https://indiepocalypse.social/@essentialrandom), [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/essentialrandom.bsky.social), [twitter](https://x.com/essentialrandom), [tumblr](https://essential-randomness.tumblr.com/)), or keep up with our programming branch, FujoWebDev ([mastodon](https://blorbo.social/@fujowebdev), [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/fujoweb.dev), [twitter](https://x.com/fujowebdev), [tumblr](https://fujowebdev.tumblr.com/))\!   
* **What are we streaming about?** We’re currently deep into more ATproto (and lexicons)   
  experimentation with a series of streams dedicated to “building a GuestBook lexicon”\! You can catch a recording of the first one (building the lexicon) here, and the second one (catching lexicon events) here\! We’ll continue this series until we can get a fully-working guestbook set up\!

### FujoStore Highlights: Restocks, Sales, and Limited-Time Offers 

* **Cookie Up a Challenge**: We have something *in store* (literally) for the brave explorers who can find the cookies hidden all over [our online parlor](https://store.fujocoded.com/): a FREE prize that includes (among other things) a HTML, CSS *and* JS learn-along—or will, when it ships late May. Technically this is part of our now concluded April 1st event, and we were just too busy to remove it. But who’s complaining? Offer valid until the end of the month…*at least\!*

### You can help\!

Last but not least, our usual call for hired help and/or willing volunteers\! This month we’re once again happy to share a paid position: come forth technical writers (and aspiring such), and let us bring you on a [Now Paying Money](https://www.npmjs.com/) adventure\!

* **Smithing Words📝…for Money (💰):** After much time, feedback, and outlining, the “Introduction to JavaScript with NPM” articles financed through our founding campaign are ready to be written\! Now, we’re finally looking for technical writers (fannish background appreciated) to help us grow our audience of HTML and CSS dabblers into confident explorers of everything [the NPM ecosystem](https://www.npmjs.com/about) has to offer—and yes, [we (also) mean Astro](https://astro.build/). 

  Check out some of the articles [in our learning website](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/quickstarts/terminal-commands/) for an example of what the final artifacts should look like, and get in touch if you’re up for the (paid) task\! We appreciate both basic computer knowledge and the willingness to run simple command line programs, but previous experience with *professional* technical writing or existing knowledge of NPM are not required. 

* **Smithing Videos📹…for Glory:** Are you willing to wrangle video wranglers? BobaBoard’s documentation bubble is looking for a wondrous individual who can help coordinate the efforts of our wonderful video volunteers as they turn our many, many hours of recorded web development and BobaBoard documentation content into something the whole FujoVerse™ and beyond can take advantage of. If you have previous experience with managing work on video or have been part of similar work and want to build some managing experience of your own, reach out\!

If any of these calls for aid sound up your alley, or if you’d like to get involved in other ways, let us know at [contacts@fujocoded.com](mailto:contacts@fujocoded.com)!
