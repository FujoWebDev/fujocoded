Geese (and fujin) invaded the first ATproto conference, with us leading the
charge: through the power of community (and in less than 5 hours) [we got work-safe geese
yaoi on the
screen](https://bsky.app/profile/essentialrandom.bsky.social/post/3ll3ov3hqhs2r).
Now _that_ is what we call impact!

## Recent Progress on the Fujoshi Guide to Web Development
* **Beta Git Ready:** As promised, we‚Äôve reviewed the alpha version of our GitHub guide and started our second pass, preparing it to become a full-fledged beta\! This involved a full reread to get us back into the (better-structured-than-feared) swing of things, fixing some hacky ‚Äúcustom zine software‚Äù workarounds from the launch of ‚ÄúIssue 1: Git (preview edition)‚Äù, and looking back at the original beta feedback to *git ready* from  some targeted improvements.

## What‚Äôs Next for FujoGuide
 * **Git Beta Ready:** With the beta re-read, the feedback reviewed, and all our horrible hacks forever removed from the codebase‚Äî*ah\! As if\!*‚Äîit‚Äôs time to Whip this Beta into Shape‚Ä¶ ‚Äútitle of my fanfiction,‚Äù as they say.  
* **Git Ready, Beta:** As we *git* the beta ready, we also need to *git* ourselves some beta‚Ä¶testers\! We‚Äôve got quite a few potential candidates from our communities, but we‚Äôll be looking to balance a wide range of experience, interest, and operating systems to make the best guide we can. We‚Äôre planning to start mid-May (just a few weeks\!) so by the time you hear back from us again, we might have already started, or at least be close to doing so. 

## Around the FujoVerse

### In the press

![](./images/retro.png)

- **Back to the Bubbles:** We‚Äôve published the [Bobaboard retrospective](https://bobaboard.com/retro/development-logs-12)\! This is a once-a-year look back at everything our Bubbly Bubbles of BobaBoard volunteers (some of us included) have been up to. Whilst BobaBoard became our first graduated project last year (and thus moved out of the FujoCoded nest, it‚Äôs still deeply tied to us, and we‚Äôre helping each other as need be‚Äîespecially when it comes to effort that benefits both of us (contracts\! Documentation\!)
- **Bubbling to the Future:** ‚Ä¶and just so you know, the retrospective also includes a section on [BobaBoard‚Äôs plans for 2025](https://bobaboard.com/retro/development-logs-12#our-2025-plans-sociocracy-intensifies)\! If you‚Äôre curious what we‚Äôll be (also) up to, go check that out\!

### Ms Boba Streaming Schedule

- **Current schedule:** With _a whole lot_ happening all around, Ms Boba‚Äôs streams are (once again) on a best-effort basis\! While she‚Äôll try to go live on Twitch **every Thursday at 3PM Pacific**, the corresponding 3PM Monday slot comes and goes. To get notified when she streams, you can subscribe to her on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/essentialrandomness), follow her on socials ([mastodon](https://indiepocalypse.social/@essentialrandom), [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/essentialrandom.bsky.social), [twitter](https://x.com/essentialrandom), [tumblr](https://essential-randomness.tumblr.com/)), or keep up with our programming branch, FujoWebDev ([mastodon](https://blorbo.social/@fujowebdev), [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/fujoweb.dev), [twitter](https://x.com/fujowebdev), [tumblr](https://fujowebdev.tumblr.com/))\!
- **What are we streaming about?** We‚Äôre currently deep into more ATproto (and lexicons)  
  experimentation with a series of streams dedicated to ‚Äúbuilding a GuestBook lexicon‚Äù\! You can catch a recording:
  1. Part 1: **Building the Lexicon:**
  2. Part 2: **Catching Events:**
     We‚Äôll continue this series until we have a fully-working guestbook set up\!

### FujoStore Highlights: Restocks, Sales, and Limited-Time Offers

![file:](./images/digital-pack.png)

- **Cookie Up a Challenge**: We have something _in store_ (literally) for the brave explorers who can find the cookies hidden all over [our online parlor](https://store.fujocoded.com/): a FREE prize that includes (among other things) a HTML, CSS _and_ JS learn-along‚Äîor will, when it ships late May. Technically this is part of our now concluded April 1st event, and we were just too busy to remove it. But who‚Äôs complaining? Offer valid until the end of the month‚Ä¶_at least\!_

### You can help\!

Last but not least, our usual call for hired help and/or willing volunteers\! This month we‚Äôre once again happy to share a paid position: come forth technical writers (and aspiring such), and let us bring you on a _**N**ow **P**aying **M**oney_ adventure\!

- **Smithing Wordsüìù‚Ä¶for Money (üí∞):** After much time, feedback, and outlining, the ‚ÄúIntroduction to JavaScript with NPM‚Äù articles financed through our founding campaign are ready to be written\! Now <u>we‚Äôre finally looking for technical writers</u> (fannish background appreciated) to help us inspire new, confident explorers of everything [the NPM ecosystem](https://www.npmjs.com/about) has to offer‚Äîand yes, [we (also) mean Astro](https://astro.build/).

  Check out [some of the articles in our learning website](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/quickstarts/terminal-commands/) for an example of what the final artifacts should look like, and **get in touch if you‚Äôre up for the (paid) task\!** We require both basic computer knowledge and the willingness to run simple command line programs, but we don't require previous experience with _professional_ technical writing NOR pre-existing knowledge of NPM/JavaScript. Just send us some tutorials or other explainers you've written!

- **Smithing Videosüìπ‚Ä¶for Glory:** Are you willing to wrangle video wranglers? BobaBoard‚Äôs documentation bubble is looking for <u>a wondrous lead volunteer to coordinate our wonderful video volunteers</u> as they turn our many, many hours of recorded web development and BobaBoard documentation into something the whole FujoVerse‚Ñ¢ and beyond can put to good use. If you have previous experience with managing work on video, or have been part of similar work and want to build some managing experience of your own, reach out\!

If any of these calls for aid sound up your alley, or if you‚Äôd like to get involved in other ways, please reach out at [contacts@fujocoded.com](mailto:contacts@fujocoded.com)!


That‚Äôs all folks!
