Item description for Fandom Cookies - Digital Item Pack. Free upon collecting the cookies across the site. 

Prophet Boba-tan, in homage to Cookie Run's Prophet Cookie. Wise Boba-tan, garbed in her white and red wizardy cloak, peers over her luxurious fortune cookie beard to deeply ponder the future as seen within her tapioca boba ball.

She speaks of words of wisdom, of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Behind her are a mock-up of a paper fortune teller template, and a circuit board pattern adorning the image.

What's this? A special, exclusive surprise for the brave cookie collector?! 

This pack contains (at least) 3 digital items: cootie (crossed out) cookie catcher, fortune generator JavaScript learn-along, and assorted cookies wallpapers.
