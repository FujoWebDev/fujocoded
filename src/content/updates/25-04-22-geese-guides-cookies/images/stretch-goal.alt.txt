Stretch Goal #2 It’s time! With our first sticker unlocked, we move to a new category of rewards: beginner-friendly articles to publish on our teaching hub, fujoweb.dev.  Once we reach this goal, we’ll contract with a tech writer from our network to fix a major roadblock for new web developers: understanding the Node Package Manager (NPM), and using it to create, use, or collaborate on modern JavaScript applications. The image has celebratory confetti and a big &quot;unlocked&quot; stamp.
