# FujoCoded LLC: Geese, Guides, and Good Luck Cookies ü™øüìîü•†

Geese (and fujin) invaded the first ATproto conference, with us leading the charge: through the power of community, and in less than 5 hours [we got geese yaoi on the screen](https://bsky.app/profile/essentialrandom.bsky.social/post/3ll3ov3hqhs2r) (SFW). Now *that* is what we call impact!


## FujoCoded General Company News
* **Setting Some ATmosphere:** March 22-23 saw us join the [ATmosphere conference](https://atprotocol.dev/atmosphereconf/), the first conference dedicated to the ATproto ecosystem‚Äîthat is, the protocol behind apps like BlueSky (and more). The conference was an incredible gathering of people who *really, really care* about a freer and more independent web ([check out all talks here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-H1nzWHLoI&list=PLyIg0j_mbb2tVegEMBg5ke2Z-1ALksU-I&ref=atprotocol.dev)), and fujin-friendly, to say the least: not only the organizers invited Ms Boba after hearing about her [ATproto experiments for fujin](https://atfujo.fujocoded.com/), but much affectionate talk was made about everyone‚Äôs new OTP: conference mascot Gustopher and The Untitled Goose Game goose‚Ä¶

* **Getting Geese‚Äôd:** So, in a span of just 5 hours, from putting out the call to hearing back joyous honks of love, we got not just one or two, but *many* submissions of tasteful \#goosetopher fanart ‚Äî [and even got them on the closing slides of the ATmosphere conference](https://bsky.app/profile/essentialrandom.bsky.social/post/3ll3ov3hqhs2r)\! Let‚Äôs hope Gustopher‚Äôs a good influence on his new paramour. 

* **Miss Speaking:** Ms Boba gave a fantastic talk at the conference with a great response\! Throughout the conference, there was a lot of audience interest in how we can get more communities involved in the future of the (social) web, which is absolutely perfect for us. Check out the full details in [the BobaBoard retrospective](https://bobaboard.com/retro/development-logs-12#prelude-back-to-the-future), or go straight to [her talk ‚ÄúYearning for the Open Protocols‚Äù here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnRWKjYVn0).   
  * Just remember: there‚Äôs a fine line to walk between building up your professional profile, and maintaining sensible internet anonymity, which is why Ms Boba attended in disguise‚Äîif you think you now know what she looks like, no you don't. 

* **Bake Sale:** In other news, we had a delicious return to April 1st tradition with a treat rather than a ~~trick~~ large-scale fundraiser‚Äî[Yaoi fortune cookies](https://store.fujocoded.com/fandom-cookies)\! On sale were ‚ÄúChocolate Doves‚Äù, ‚ÄúKinda Vanilla‚Äù, and ‚ÄúLemony Prompts‚Äù, each with its own set of specifically-crafted fortunes. We even got some [lovely](https://www.tumblr.com/harvestspriteirl/780416155855765504/choco-dove-sweep-this-determines-the-bedroom) [fanart](https://blorbo.social/@LeGaosaure/114309563070767137) Chocolate Doves flew over the competition to [win our cookie run](https://bsky.app/profile/fujocoded.bsky.social/post/3lmn5ovzv6s2y), but really, aren‚Äôt we all winners? Nope, only the doves. Check out our contributors spotlight on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/fujocoded.bsky.social/post/3lmkmknupas2h), [Mastodon](https://blorbo.social/@fujocoded/114320796135859218), [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/fujocoded/780556227268771840/with-only-24-hoursish-left-to-buy-your-fandom?source=share), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fujoc0ded/status/1910754458520478144)\!  
* **Hiring Fun(ds):** And of course, selling cookies is not just delicious fun, it gives us enough money for our next goal: hiring a sysadmin to help us better setup our servers to be reliable, and alert us if anything happens\! Who knows, this might finally make us confident enough to host stuff for *you* in the future\! 

### Recent Progress on Our Backerkit Campaign

* **Writing Frenzy:** It‚Äôs not all geese and gobbling, we also wrote (and then rewrote ad infinitum) the outline for our soon-to-be-famous NPM article\! We might have had it (mostly) ready for the last newsletter, but Ms Boba spent some time rearranging it after a break‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs now four whole articles\! That might stretch the budget a bit, but it‚Äôs also going to cover most of what we‚Äôve learned the community is struggling with.   
* **Village People:** Still, it takes a village to code (and learn to code) a website so we gathered a bunch of great and enthusiastic feedback from the Fandom Coders community to make this article even better. We even got it reviewed from one of BobaBoard‚Äôs professional volunteer tech writers to ensure our outline can set our future hire (see below) up for success\!

### What‚Äôs Next for the FujoCoded Backerkit
* **Extended Contracts:** Our contracts are, to quote sociocracy, ‚Äúgood enough for now, safe enough to try‚Äù, but they need a bit of extending to be suitable for tech writers too\! And we‚Äôll need this ASAP because‚Ä¶   
* **Needed Prose Master**:... we‚Äôre looking to hire a tech writer for the NPM articles, which we‚Äôll pay for with the funds raised through the corresponding stretch goal of our BackerKit campaign\! If you‚Äôd like this to be you (or someone you know), check out our call for hire below\!

## Recent Progress on the Fujoshi Guide to Web Development
* **Beta Git Ready:** As promised, we‚Äôve reviewed the alpha version of our GitHub guide and started our second pass, preparing it to become a full-fledged beta\! This involved a full reread to get us back into the (better-structured-than-feared) swing of things, fixing some hacky ‚Äúcustom zine software‚Äù workarounds from the launch of ‚ÄúIssue 1: Git (preview edition)‚Äù, and looking back at the original beta feedback to *git ready* from  some targeted improvements.

## What‚Äôs Next for FujoGuide
 * **Git Beta Ready:** With the beta re-read, the feedback reviewed, and all our horrible hacks forever removed from the codebase‚Äî*ah\! As if\!*‚Äîit‚Äôs time to Whip this Beta into Shape‚Ä¶ ‚Äútitle of my fanfiction,‚Äù as they say.  
* **Git Ready, Beta:** As we *git* the beta ready, we also need to *git* ourselves some beta‚Ä¶testers\! We‚Äôve got quite a few potential candidates from our communities, but we‚Äôll be looking to balance a wide range of experience, interest, and operating systems to make the best guide we can. We‚Äôre planning to start mid-May (just a few weeks\!) so by the time you hear back from us again, we might have already started, or at least be close to doing so. 

### Around the FujoVerse

#### In the press

* **Back to the Bubbles:** We‚Äôve published the [Bobaboard retrospective](https://bobaboard.com/retro/development-logs-12)\! This is a once-a-year look back at everything our Bubbly Bubbles of BobaBoard volunteers (some of us included) have been up to. Whilst BobaBoard became our first graduated project last year (and thus moved out of the FujoCoded nest, it‚Äôs still deeply tied to us, and we‚Äôre helping each other as need be‚Äîespecially when it comes to effort that benefits both of us (contracts\! Documentation\!)  
* **Bubbling to the Future:** ‚Ä¶and just so you know, the retrospective also includes a section on [BobaBoard‚Äôs plans for 2025](https://bobaboard.com/retro/development-logs-12#our-2025-plans-sociocracy-intensifies)\! If you‚Äôre curious what we‚Äôll be (also) up to, go check that out\!

#### Ms Boba Streaming Schedule

* **Current schedule:** With *a whole lot* happening all around, Ms Boba‚Äôs streams are (once again) on a best-effort basis\! While she‚Äôll try to go live on Twitch **every Thursday at 3PM Pacific**, the corresponding 3PM Monday slot comes and goes. To get notified when she streams, you can subscribe to her on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/essentialrandomness), follow her on socials ([mastodon](https://indiepocalypse.social/@essentialrandom), [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/essentialrandom.bsky.social), [twitter](https://x.com/essentialrandom), [tumblr](https://essential-randomness.tumblr.com/)), or keep up with our programming branch, FujoWebDev ([mastodon](https://blorbo.social/@fujowebdev), [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/fujoweb.dev), [twitter](https://x.com/fujowebdev), [tumblr](https://fujowebdev.tumblr.com/))\!   
* **What are we streaming about?** We‚Äôre currently deep into more ATproto (and lexicons)   
  experimentation with a series of streams dedicated to ‚Äúbuilding a GuestBook lexicon‚Äù\! You can catch a recording of the first one (building the lexicon) here, and the second one (catching lexicon events) here\! We‚Äôll continue this series until we can get a fully-working guestbook set up\!

### FujoStore Highlights: Restocks, Sales, and Limited-Time Offers 

* **Cookie Up a Challenge**: We have something *in store* (literally) for the brave explorers who can find the cookies hidden all over [our online parlor](https://store.fujocoded.com/): a FREE prize that includes (among other things) a HTML, CSS *and* JS learn-along‚Äîor will, when it ships late May. Technically this is part of our now concluded April 1st event, and we were just too busy to remove it. But who‚Äôs complaining? Offer valid until the end of the month‚Ä¶*at least\!*

### You can help\!

Last but not least, our usual call for hired help and/or willing volunteers\! This month we‚Äôre once again happy to share a paid position: come forth technical writers (and aspiring such), and let us bring you on a [Now Paying Money](https://www.npmjs.com/) adventure\!

* **Smithing Wordsüìù‚Ä¶for Money (üí∞):** After much time, feedback, and outlining, the ‚ÄúIntroduction to JavaScript with NPM‚Äù articles financed through our founding campaign are ready to be written\! Now, we‚Äôre finally looking for technical writers (fannish background appreciated) to help us grow our audience of HTML and CSS dabblers into confident explorers of everything [the NPM ecosystem](https://www.npmjs.com/about) has to offer‚Äîand yes, [we (also) mean Astro](https://astro.build/). 

  Check out some of the articles [in our learning website](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/quickstarts/terminal-commands/) for an example of what the final artifacts should look like, and get in touch if you‚Äôre up for the (paid) task\! We appreciate both basic computer knowledge and the willingness to run simple command line programs, but previous experience with *professional* technical writing or existing knowledge of NPM are not required. 

* **Smithing Videosüìπ‚Ä¶for Glory:** Are you willing to wrangle video wranglers? BobaBoard‚Äôs documentation bubble is looking for a wondrous individual who can help coordinate the efforts of our wonderful video volunteers as they turn our many, many hours of recorded web development and BobaBoard documentation content into something the whole FujoVerse‚Ñ¢ and beyond can take advantage of. If you have previous experience with managing work on video or have been part of similar work and want to build some managing experience of your own, reach out\!

If any of these calls for aid sound up your alley, or if you‚Äôd like to get involved in other ways, let us know at [contacts@fujocoded.com](mailto:contacts@fujocoded.com)!



That‚Äôs all folks!

Love,
The FujoCoded Team
