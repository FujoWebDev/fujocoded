title: "Careers, Cookies, and Cons - We're Hiring!"
---

Greetings, fujoshi, fudanshi, fujin, and friends,

This month, we bring you a double-heaping of hiring, conventions, and cookies to make up for the fact that May‚Äôs newsletter is late (or is June‚Äôs early?)‚Äîwe‚Äôve got a lot more than Yaoi cookies on our plates, so we‚Äôre eager to outsource some of it. Time to put *you* (and our bake sale funds) to work. 

See below for more details! 


## FujoCoded General Company News

- **Summer Jobs** It‚Äôs hiring season! With Ms Boba‚Äôs workload getting more packed than Git's line of suitors, we have decided to wrestle as much as we can away from her and give it to some of you (for a fee)! Along with our classic [artist business card drop off](https://forms.gle/Cm2wq9numpBMoUZJA), we now have two more: one for [writers](https://forms.gle/DensB2JHppK4A98M8), and one for small-gig [HTML/CSS (and/or) JS wranglers](https://forms.gle/HNMHCJ5N5XoV35Y27)! Details at the end üëá .

- **The Servers‚Äô Panopticon** And speaking of hiring‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs celebrate the great first month-iversary of our new SysAdmin, [Kat](https://bsky.app/profile/kat.bsky.girlonthemoon.xyz)! After familiarizing herself with NixOS, she‚Äôs been going to town on our server configuration and now we can track all our different sites and tools, including when they go down.

![ID: A status page showing each of the FujoVerse services. All of them are at 100% and in green except for fanworksfeeds which is at 0% and in red. End ID](./images/status.png)

- **How to Save a Feed** As you can see from the red above, the labeling website for [our Bluesky fanworks feed](https://bsky.app/profile/fanworkslabels.bsky.social) project has been down for quite a while. Initially, we broke the laws of DevOps and just manually resurrected it every time the server went down, but we (predictably) forgot to keep doing it after a while. Now that she‚Äôs on board, we‚Äôve set Kat to aligning the bones and blood just right to bring it back to life‚Ä¶ forever! \

- **Labelers Necromancy** Similarly, Kat brought our other Bluesky account labelers ([‚ÄúYour Fujin Animal‚Äù](https://bsky.app/profile/fujinlabeler.bsky.social) and [‚ÄúChoose your AO3 rating!‚Äù](https://bsky.app/profile/ao3labeler.bsky.social)) back to the (im)mortal plane‚Äîalthough the Bluesky algorithm is upset at our long absence and won‚Äôt show the labels for the latter. If you‚Äôve been unable to get one of our badges, try again! It may not display immediately, but we‚Äôre working to appease our social overlords. All hail to Kat, our Necromancer Supreme! See [here](https://atfujo.fujocoded.com/) for more details on all our ATproto projects. \

- **That‚Äôs the Way the Cookie Crumbles** If you‚Äôre waiting for your delicious cookies (and the website trackers aren't doing it for you), they‚Äôre baking as we speak! The original order didn‚Äôt find enough gluten-free aficionados to meet minimum quantities, but after putting them back on sale briefly we smashed that threshold and got them in the oven! Production has started and soon y‚Äôall will have all the tasty treats you can cram in your mouths, whether you‚Äôre a gluten glutton or not.  \

- **Baking Your Own** We‚Äôve been hard at work on the web-dev learn-along included in our latest digital pack: a ‚Äúfortune cookie‚Äù generator website based on our cookie fortunes (with some never-before-seen ones!) The code comes in beginner and intermediate versions, and it‚Äôs chock-full of helpful comments, HTML and CSS features you may be new to, and some neat JavaScript tricks to help you get started! It was free during the fortune cookies campaign, but if you missed it [you can now pre-order it for $5](https://store.fujocoded.com/products/fandom-cookies/fandom-cookies-digital-items-pack-discounted) (or read below for a discount üëÄ)! \

## Recent Progress on Our Backerkit Campaign 

- **NPM on the Way **We‚Äôve hired not one, but two new writers for our NPM series! [Arrow](http://aroceu.com) and Rie (aka [notavodkashot](https://notavodkashot.carrd.co/)) will tackle the first two introductory articles: just enough to teach *us* how well our new writing process works, and teach *you* about NodeJS and the very basics of NPM. Come try them out in our ‚ÄúWebDev Support‚Äù thread at [CitrusCon](https://www.citruscon.com) (more on that later)!

- **Will Trade Money for Words** As you might expect, we have *a lot* to write! And in the newfound spirit of delegation (and to give Ms Boba time to breathe), we‚Äôre looking to hire *even more* new writers! We now have a [permanent drop off box](https://forms.gle/DensB2JHppK4A98M8) for you to throw your name in the ring. As the person currently writing this newsletter, it‚Äôs a good gig! It pays well and Ms Boba only uses the whip with your enthusiastic consent.

- **A Fujo‚Äôs Guide to Style** But we won‚Äôt be throwing you into the deep end without some floaties! Our technical writing gig now comes with a whole style guide explaining how, why, and for whom this stuff should be written. A big job that will help our newfound writing team stay true to the Boba flavour you know and love. 

- **Arg-uing with (the) Terminal** Finally, we're expanding our [terminal series](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/) to explain two key topics: **arguments and parameters**. The initial guide was dedicated to all the basics, but we found that a bit more was needed to cover all our* bas(h)*es..So we sat one of our hired monkeys at a new typewriter, and asked Jaffa (currently writing this same newsletter) to create an article outline for a future writer to fill in.

## What's Next for the FujoCoded Backerkit

- **Manifesting our Writing** It‚Äôs time to get those NPM articles written and delivered! With our valiant writers finally hired and set up, this should be a smooth process. We‚Äôre looking forward to getting these into your hands, so that you can go from fiddling with our fortune cookie generator, to granting your website wishes yourselves (or falling into a labyrinth of frameworks, up to you).  \

- **Duty() Calls** Still, two articles does not a series make, and with that in mind: we need *you* to submit an entry into our [writers business card drop off](https://forms.gle/DensB2JHppK4A98M8)! We‚Äôll soon be looking to hire more writers to keep the NPM goodness flowing, with the next articles focusing on going beyond how to get started with NPM and serve as a reference for concepts that will come in handy as you practice and grow.

## Around the FujoVerse

### In the press
* **Getting Conned 2: the Reconnening **We‚Äôll be attending [CitrusCon](https://www.citruscon.com/) again, with Ms Boba giving a talk on how to work together as a community even when everything, well... *kinda sucks*. 

![ID: A screenshot event listing for CitrusCon titled "Working Together in a Dying World".

The host is Ms Boba (she/her) from FujoCoded over Zoom and it runs 1:30PM - 2:30PM Eastern Timezone. 

The description is "There's no denying it: shit's fucked. From the internet to the world at large‚Äîand even within our own communities‚Äîit feels like everything‚Äôs falling apart. If we're going to make it through, we'll have to do what every ragtag team must: learn to work together. But how do you do that when everything already feels too much?"

End ID](images/citruscon_talk.png)

At the con you‚Äôll also find a discount code for our store, and a space to come meet us and get help with your web-dev questions. **If you‚Äôd like to [register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/citrus-con-2025-tickets-949332648507), it‚Äôs free but you gotta do it by June 19th!** 

- **Better Late than Never: **And speaking of Ms Boba yapping about building collaborative organizations, she‚Äôs just started publishing the blog version of her talk from last year‚Äôs CitrusCon, [‚ÄúRebuilding Community on the (Fujo)Web‚Äù](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/posts/rebuilding-community-on-the-web/part-1). It‚Äôs got everything you want in a fic‚ÄîI mean, talk: interpersonal struggle, power dynamics, and a call for Fujos to Assemble.

- **Leaving the Nest **We also started transitioning the governance of our Fandom Coders Discord server to [Sociocracy](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/content/), so that it can grow big and strong with the direct support of its members. This‚Äôll help in our effort to make FujoCoded‚Äôs own load more sustainable, and means the community will soon have the power to decide how its own spaces should be run. The first meeting of the Transition bubble/team kicked off to a great start, and the second meeting is already scheduled. 

- **Taken for Granted** Ms Boba [won](https://bsky.app/profile/essentialrandom.bsky.social/post/3lqb53vot7c23) a coveted ‚Äú[graze grant](https://bsky.app/profile/graze.social/post/3lohcyw37fc2j)‚Äù for her ongoing [ATproto guestbook project](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/lexicon-guestbook), which you can watch her [build on stream](https://www.twitch.tv/collections/OdaSBo9XORgtPQ). She‚Äôs planning to use that grant to finance technical writing specifically around that project, making decentralization through [ATproto](https://atproto.com/) more legible to technical and non-technical folks alike. Once done, the guestbook will let you start collecting messages from friends and visitors, even on static sites like Neocities! 

### Ms Boba Streaming Schedule

...and speaking of the guestbook, it‚Äôs now officially named Tomo, borrowing from the Japanese for ‚Äúfriend‚Äù, and the Italian word for ‚Äúbook‚Äù! We‚Äôre continuing to stream its ongoing development every Thursday at 3PM Pacific. Come along on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/essentialrandomness) and spectate (or heckle) Ms Boba as she wrestles code into place and suplexes syntax errors.  \
In the meantime, you can find all of the progress to date [on the dedicated Twitch collection](https://www.twitch.tv/collections/OdaSBo9XORgtPQ). Hope to see you there! 


### FujoStore Highlights: Restocks, Sales, and Limited-Time Offers

- üíª **WebDev Gigs incoming!** There is *a lot* going on in the FujoVerse‚Ñ¢ and many pages (like our [FujoGuide Volume 0 one](https://www.fujoweb.dev/volume-0)) could use some TLC from entry-level HTML/CSS-wranglers. We also have a few other challenges at different levels we‚Äôll be looking to take care of as we grow. [Join the fight here!](https://forms.gle/HNMHCJ5N5XoV35Y27)
