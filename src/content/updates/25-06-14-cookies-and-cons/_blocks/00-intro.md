Greetings, fujoshi, fudanshi, fujin, and friends,

This month, we bring you a double-heaping of hiring, conventions, and cookies to make up for the fact that May’s newsletter is late (or is June’s early?)—we’ve got a lot more than Yaoi cookies on our plates, so we’re eager to outsource some of it. Time to put *you* (and our bake sale funds) to work. 

See below for more details!
