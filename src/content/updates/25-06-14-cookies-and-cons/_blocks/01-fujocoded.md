## FujoCoded General Company News

- **Summer Jobs:** It’s hiring season! With Ms Boba’s workload getting more packed than Git's line of suitors, we have decided to wrestle as much as we can away from her and give it to some of you (for a fee)! Along with our classic [artist business card drop off](https://forms.gle/Cm2wq9numpBMoUZJA), we now have two more: one for [writers](https://forms.gle/DensB2JHppK4A98M8), and one for small-gig [HTML/CSS (and/or) JS wranglers](https://forms.gle/HNMHCJ5N5XoV35Y27)! Details at the end 👇

- **The Servers’ Panopticon:** And speaking of hiring… Let’s celebrate the great first month-iversary of our new SysAdmin, [Kat](https://bsky.app/profile/kat.bsky.girlonthemoon.xyz)! After familiarizing herself with NixOS, she’s been going to town on our server configuration and now we can track all our different sites and tools, including when they go down.

- **How to Save a Feed:** As you can see from the red above, the labeling website for [our Bluesky fanworks feed](https://bsky.app/profile/fanworkslabels.bsky.social) project has been down for quite a while. Initially, we broke the laws of DevOps and just manually resurrected it every time the server went down, but we (predictably) forgot to keep doing it after a while. Now that she’s on board, we’ve set Kat to aligning the bones and blood just right to bring it back to life… forever!

- **Labelers Necromancy:** Similarly, Kat brought our other Bluesky account labelers ([“Your Fujin Animal”](https://bsky.app/profile/fujinlabeler.bsky.social) and [“Choose your AO3 rating!”](https://bsky.app/profile/ao3labeler.bsky.social)) back to the (im)mortal plane—although the Bluesky algorithm is upset at our long absence and won’t show the labels for the latter. If you’ve been unable to get one of our badges, try again! It may not display immediately, but we’re working to appease our social overlords. All hail to Kat, our Necromancer Supreme! See [here](https://atfujo.fujocoded.com/) for more details on all our ATproto projects.

- **That’s the Way the Cookie Crumbles:** If you’re waiting for your delicious cookies (and the website trackers aren't doing it for you), they’re baking as we speak! The original order didn’t find enough gluten-free aficionados to meet minimum quantities, but after putting them back on sale briefly we smashed that threshold and got them in the oven! Production has started and soon y’all will have all the tasty treats you can cram in your mouths, whether you’re a gluten glutton or not.

- **Baking Your Own:** We’ve been hard at work on the web-dev learn-along included in our latest digital pack: a “fortune cookie” generator website based on our cookie fortunes (with some never-before-seen ones!) The code comes in beginner and intermediate versions, and it’s chock-full of helpful comments, HTML and CSS features you may be new to, and some neat JavaScript tricks to help you get started! It was free during the fortune cookies campaign, but if you missed it [you can now pre-order it for $5](https://store.fujocoded.com/products/fandom-cookies/fandom-cookies-digital-items-pack-discounted) (or read below for a discount 👀)!
