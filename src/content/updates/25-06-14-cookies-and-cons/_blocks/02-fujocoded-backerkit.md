## FujoCoded Backerkit Update

### Recent Progress on Our Backerkit Campaign

- **NPM on the Way:** We’ve hired not one, but two new writers for our NPM series! **[Arrow](http://aroceu.com) and Rie (aka [notavodkashot](https://notavodkashot.carrd.co/)) will tackle the first two introductory articles:** just enough to teach _us_ how well our new writing process works, and teach _you_ about NodeJS and the very basics of NPM. Come try them out in our “WebDev Support” thread at [CitrusCon](https://www.citruscon.com) (more on that later)!

- **Will Trade Money for Words:** As you might expect, we have _a lot_ to write! And in the newfound spirit of delegation (and to give Ms Boba time to breathe), we’re looking to hire _even more_ new writers! **We now have a [permanent Writer Business Card drop off box](https://forms.gle/DensB2JHppK4A98M8)** for you to throw your name in the ring. As the person currently writing this newsletter, it’s a good gig! It pays well and Ms Boba only uses the whip with your enthusiastic consent.

- **A Fujo’s Guide to Style:** But we won’t be throwing you into the deep end without some floaties! **Our technical writing gig(s) now comes with a whole style guide** explaining how, why, and for whom this stuff should be written. A big job that will help our newfound writing team stay true to the Boba flavour you know and love. It isn't public yet, but... maybe soon!

- **Arg-uing with (the) Terminal:** Finally, **we're expanding our [terminal series](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/) to explain two key topics: _arguments and parameters_.** The initial guide was dedicated to all the basics, but we found that a bit more was needed to cover all our *bas(h)*es..So we sat one of our hired monkeys at a new typewriter, and asked Jaffa (currently writing this same newsletter) to create an article outline for a future writer to fill in.

### What's Next for the FujoCoded Backerkit

- **Manifesting our Writing:** It’s **time to get those NPM articles written and delivered!** With two valiant writers finally hired and set up, this should be a smooth process. We’re looking forward to getting these into your hands, so that you can go from fiddling with our fortune cookie generator, to granting your website wishes yourselves (or falling into a labyrinth of frameworks, up to you).

- **Duty() Calls:** Still, two articles does not a series make, and with that in mind: we need _you_ to submit an entry into our [writers business card drop off](https://forms.gle/DensB2JHppK4A98M8)! **We’ll soon be looking to hire more writers to keep the NPM goodness flowing**, with the next articles focusing on going beyond how to get started with NPM and serve as a reference for concepts that will come in handy as you practice and grow.
