## The Fujoshi Guide to Web Development

### Recent Progress on the FujoGuide

- **No Time to Zine:** With our focus on outsourcing as much work as we can (and especially hiring writers for our NPM articles) **we unfortunately didn’t have space to finish the rewrite of FujoGuide Issue 2 (GitHub).** But while the planned beta has slipped, we’re hoping that the onboarding of new writers will give us a lot more capacity to get this zine _and more_ out to you quickly once things stabilize!

- **Bunches of Badges:** That said, we would never leave you empty-handed, so we’ve created two additional rewards: the first one is **a new website badge _exclusively_ for those who donated to our FujoGuide Kickstarter**, which will pair up nicely with the one you already have that we give out to everyone who buys the zine...

- **A Glaring of Catboys:** ...and the second reward is we’re finishing up our catboys pantheon (_penta_-on? Panther-on?), with the last 2 catboys of 5: **Gitea + Forgejo now have their own character sheets,** as well as exclusive designs by our own resident catboy wrangler [BrokeMyCrown](https://www.fujoweb.dev/team/brokemycrown), who authored our whole cat-ty lineup.

  These two twins have been at each other's throats since Gitea sold out to Big Daddy Microsoft and became a teaboo, but we’re planning to corral them into your rewards folder soon (or email inbox if you’ve lost that).

- **Back-alley Catboys:** If you didn’t back our KickStarter but would still like to Kick Back with the Katboys™ (or our other behind-the-scenes material) **head down to our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/fujocoded) for character and production sheets,** free wallpapers, and other goodies! We looked into setting up our catboys with an OnlyFans instead, but they kept knocking the cameras over and it was a whole mess.

### What’s Next for FujoGuide

- **Git’ing Touchy:** We’re putting the final touches on the new badges and catboy character sheets, and **these new rewards will be corralled into your rewards folder soon!** If you can’t remember where that is, don’t worry: we’ll be sending out email reminders too. If only we can find it ourselves...

- **Beta? I ‘ardly know ‘er! (_sorry_ 🥺):** Don’t worry: **we’re still planning to get the GitHub beta underway as soon as we can!** Ms Boba’s currently focused on CitrusCon like a pirate dying of scurvy, but once we resurrect her using dark magic (that is, plenty of coffee) we’ll be sailing full steam ahead to getting this out. We’ll keep you posted!
