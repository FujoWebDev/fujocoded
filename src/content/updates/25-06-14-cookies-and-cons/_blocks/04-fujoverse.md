## Around the FujoVerse

### In the press

- **Getting Conned 2: the Reconnening:** We‚Äôll be attending [CitrusCon](https://www.citruscon.com/) again, with Ms Boba giving a talk on how to work together as a community even when everything, well... _kinda sucks_.

  At the con you‚Äôll also find a discount code for our store, and a space to come meet us and get help with your web-dev questions. **If you‚Äôd like to [register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/citrus-con-2025-tickets-949332648507), it‚Äôs free but you gotta do it by June 19th!**

- **Better Late than Never:** And speaking of Ms Boba yapping about building collaborative organizations, she‚Äôs just started publishing the blog version of her talk from last year‚Äôs CitrusCon, [‚ÄúRebuilding Community on the (Fujo)Web‚Äù](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/posts/rebuilding-community-on-the-web/part-1). It‚Äôs got everything you want in a fic‚ÄîI mean, talk: interpersonal struggle, power dynamics, and a call for Fujos to Assemble.

- **Leaving the Nest:** We also started transitioning the governance of our Fandom Coders Discord server to [Sociocracy](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/content/), so that it can grow big and strong with the direct support of its members. This‚Äôll help in our effort to make FujoCoded‚Äôs own load more sustainable, and means the community will soon have the power to decide how its own spaces should be run. The first meeting of the Transition bubble/team kicked off to a great start, and the second meeting is already scheduled.

- **Taken for Granted:** Ms Boba [won](https://bsky.app/profile/essentialrandom.bsky.social/post/3lqb53vot7c23) a coveted ‚Äú[graze grant](https://bsky.app/profile/graze.social/post/3lohcyw37fc2j)‚Äù for her ongoing [ATproto guestbook project](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/lexicon-guestbook), which you can watch her [build on stream](https://www.twitch.tv/collections/OdaSBo9XORgtPQ). She‚Äôs planning to use that grant to finance technical writing specifically around that project, making decentralization through [ATproto](https://atproto.com/) more legible to technical and non-technical folks alike. Once done, the guestbook will let you start collecting messages from friends and visitors, even on static sites like Neocities!

### Ms Boba Streaming Schedule

...and speaking of the guestbook, it‚Äôs now officially named Tomo, borrowing from the Japanese for ‚Äúfriend‚Äù, and the Italian word for ‚Äúbook‚Äù! We‚Äôre continuing to stream its ongoing development every Thursday at 3PM Pacific. Come along on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/essentialrandomness) and spectate (or heckle) Ms Boba as she wrestles code into place and suplexes syntax errors. \
In the meantime, you can find all of the progress to date [on the dedicated Twitch collection](https://www.twitch.tv/collections/OdaSBo9XORgtPQ). Hope to see you there!
