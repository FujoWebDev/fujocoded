title: "Careers, Cookies, and Cons - We're Hiring!"
---

Greetings, fujoshi, fudanshi, fujin, and friends,

This month, we bring you a double-heaping of hiring, conventions, and cookies to make up for the fact that May‚Äôs newsletter is late (or is June‚Äôs early?)‚Äîwe‚Äôve got a lot more than Yaoi cookies on our plates, so we‚Äôre eager to outsource some of it. Time to put *you* (and our bake sale funds) to work. 

See below for more details! 


## FujoCoded General Company News

- **Summer Jobs** It‚Äôs hiring season! With Ms Boba‚Äôs workload getting more packed than Git's line of suitors, we have decided to wrestle as much as we can away from her and give it to some of you (for a fee)! Along with our classic [artist business card drop off](https://forms.gle/Cm2wq9numpBMoUZJA), we now have two more: one for [writers](https://forms.gle/DensB2JHppK4A98M8), and one for small-gig [HTML/CSS (and/or) JS wranglers](https://forms.gle/HNMHCJ5N5XoV35Y27)! Details at the end üëá .

- **The Servers‚Äô Panopticon** And speaking of hiring‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs celebrate the great first month-iversary of our new SysAdmin, [Kat](https://bsky.app/profile/kat.bsky.girlonthemoon.xyz)! After familiarizing herself with NixOS, she‚Äôs been going to town on our server configuration and now we can track all our different sites and tools, including when they go down.

![ID: A status page showing each of the FujoVerse services. All of them are at 100% and in green except for fanworksfeeds which is at 0% and in red. End ID](./images/status.png)

- **How to Save a Feed** As you can see from the red above, the labeling website for [our Bluesky fanworks feed](https://bsky.app/profile/fanworkslabels.bsky.social) project has been down for quite a while. Initially, we broke the laws of DevOps and just manually resurrected it every time the server went down, but we (predictably) forgot to keep doing it after a while. Now that she‚Äôs on board, we‚Äôve set Kat to aligning the bones and blood just right to bring it back to life‚Ä¶ forever! \

- **Labelers Necromancy** Similarly, Kat brought our other Bluesky account labelers ([‚ÄúYour Fujin Animal‚Äù](https://bsky.app/profile/fujinlabeler.bsky.social) and [‚ÄúChoose your AO3 rating!‚Äù](https://bsky.app/profile/ao3labeler.bsky.social)) back to the (im)mortal plane‚Äîalthough the Bluesky algorithm is upset at our long absence and won‚Äôt show the labels for the latter. If you‚Äôve been unable to get one of our badges, try again! It may not display immediately, but we‚Äôre working to appease our social overlords. All hail to Kat, our Necromancer Supreme! See [here](https://atfujo.fujocoded.com/) for more details on all our ATproto projects. \

- **That‚Äôs the Way the Cookie Crumbles** If you‚Äôre waiting for your delicious cookies (and the website trackers aren't doing it for you), they‚Äôre baking as we speak! The original order didn‚Äôt find enough gluten-free aficionados to meet minimum quantities, but after putting them back on sale briefly we smashed that threshold and got them in the oven! Production has started and soon y‚Äôall will have all the tasty treats you can cram in your mouths, whether you‚Äôre a gluten glutton or not.  \

- **Baking Your Own** We‚Äôve been hard at work on the web-dev learn-along included in our latest digital pack: a ‚Äúfortune cookie‚Äù generator website based on our cookie fortunes (with some never-before-seen ones!) The code comes in beginner and intermediate versions, and it‚Äôs chock-full of helpful comments, HTML and CSS features you may be new to, and some neat JavaScript tricks to help you get started! It was free during the fortune cookies campaign, but if you missed it [you can now pre-order it for $5](https://store.fujocoded.com/products/fandom-cookies/fandom-cookies-digital-items-pack-discounted) (or read below for a discount üëÄ)! \

## Recent Progress on the Fujoshi Guide to Web Development
- **No Time to Zine** With our focus on outsourcing as much work as we can (and especially hiring writers for our NPM articles) we unfortunately didn‚Äôt have space to finish the rewrite of FujoGuide Issue 2 (GitHub). But while the planned beta has slipped, we‚Äôre hoping that the onboarding of new writers will give us a lot more capacity to get this zine *and more* out to you quickly once things stabilize! 

- **Bunches of Badges** That said, we would never leave you empty-handed, so we‚Äôve created two additional rewards: the first one is a new website badge *exclusively *for those who donated to our FujoGuide Kickstarter, which will pair up nicely with the one you already have that we give out to everyone who buys the zine...

- **A Glaring of Catboys** ...and the second reward is we‚Äôre finishing up our catboys pantheon (*penta*-on? Panther-on?), with the last 2 catboys of 5: Gitea + Forgejo now have their own character sheets, as well as exclusive designs by our own resident catboy wrangler [BrokeMyCrown](https://www.fujoweb.dev/team/brokemycrown), who authored our whole cat-ty lineup. These two twins have been at each other's throats since Gitea sold out to Big Daddy Microsoft and became a teaboo, but we‚Äôre planning to corral them into your rewards folder soon (or email inbox if you‚Äôve lost that).

- **Back-alley Catboys** If you didn‚Äôt back our KickStarter but would still like to Kick Back with the Katboys‚Ñ¢ (or our other behind-the-scenes material) head down to our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/fujocoded) for character and production sheets, free wallpapers, and other goodies! We looked into setting up our catboys with an OnlyFans instead, but they kept knocking the cameras over and it was a whole mess. 

## What‚Äôs Next for FujoGuide
- **Git‚Äôing Touchy** We‚Äôre putting the final touches on the new badges and catboy character sheets, and they‚Äôll be corralled into your rewards folder soon! If you can‚Äôt remember where that is, don‚Äôt worry: we‚Äôll be sending out email reminders too. If only we can find it... 

- **Beta? I ‚Äòardly know ‚Äòer! (sorry)** Don‚Äôt worry: we‚Äôre still planning to get the GitHub beta underway as soon as we can! Ms Boba‚Äôs currently focused on CitrusCon like a pirate dying of scurvy, but once we resurrect her using dark magic (that is, plenty of coffee) we‚Äôll be sailing full steam ahead to getting this out. We‚Äôll keep you posted! 
 


## Around the FujoVerse

### In the press
* **Getting Conned 2: the Reconnening **We‚Äôll be attending [CitrusCon](https://www.citruscon.com/) again, with Ms Boba giving a talk on how to work together as a community even when everything, well... *kinda sucks*. 

![ID: A screenshot event listing for CitrusCon titled "Working Together in a Dying World".

The host is Ms Boba (she/her) from FujoCoded over Zoom and it runs 1:30PM - 2:30PM Eastern Timezone. 

The description is "There's no denying it: shit's fucked. From the internet to the world at large‚Äîand even within our own communities‚Äîit feels like everything‚Äôs falling apart. If we're going to make it through, we'll have to do what every ragtag team must: learn to work together. But how do you do that when everything already feels too much?"

End ID](images/citruscon_talk.png)

At the con you‚Äôll also find a discount code for our store, and a space to come meet us and get help with your web-dev questions. **If you‚Äôd like to [register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/citrus-con-2025-tickets-949332648507), it‚Äôs free but you gotta do it by June 19th!** 

- **Better Late than Never: **And speaking of Ms Boba yapping about building collaborative organizations, she‚Äôs just started publishing the blog version of her talk from last year‚Äôs CitrusCon, [‚ÄúRebuilding Community on the (Fujo)Web‚Äù](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/posts/rebuilding-community-on-the-web/part-1). It‚Äôs got everything you want in a fic‚ÄîI mean, talk: interpersonal struggle, power dynamics, and a call for Fujos to Assemble.

- **Leaving the Nest **We also started transitioning the governance of our Fandom Coders Discord server to [Sociocracy](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/content/), so that it can grow big and strong with the direct support of its members. This‚Äôll help in our effort to make FujoCoded‚Äôs own load more sustainable, and means the community will soon have the power to decide how its own spaces should be run. The first meeting of the Transition bubble/team kicked off to a great start, and the second meeting is already scheduled. 

- **Taken for Granted** Ms Boba [won](https://bsky.app/profile/essentialrandom.bsky.social/post/3lqb53vot7c23) a coveted ‚Äú[graze grant](https://bsky.app/profile/graze.social/post/3lohcyw37fc2j)‚Äù for her ongoing [ATproto guestbook project](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/lexicon-guestbook), which you can watch her [build on stream](https://www.twitch.tv/collections/OdaSBo9XORgtPQ). She‚Äôs planning to use that grant to finance technical writing specifically around that project, making decentralization through [ATproto](https://atproto.com/) more legible to technical and non-technical folks alike. Once done, the guestbook will let you start collecting messages from friends and visitors, even on static sites like Neocities! 

### Ms Boba Streaming Schedule

...and speaking of the guestbook, it‚Äôs now officially named Tomo, borrowing from the Japanese for ‚Äúfriend‚Äù, and the Italian word for ‚Äúbook‚Äù! We‚Äôre continuing to stream its ongoing development every Thursday at 3PM Pacific. Come along on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/essentialrandomness) and spectate (or heckle) Ms Boba as she wrestles code into place and suplexes syntax errors.  \
In the meantime, you can find all of the progress to date [on the dedicated Twitch collection](https://www.twitch.tv/collections/OdaSBo9XORgtPQ). Hope to see you there!

- üíª **WebDev Gigs incoming!** There is *a lot* going on in the FujoVerse‚Ñ¢ and many pages (like our [FujoGuide Volume 0 one](https://www.fujoweb.dev/volume-0)) could use some TLC from entry-level HTML/CSS-wranglers. We also have a few other challenges at different levels we‚Äôll be looking to take care of as we grow. [Join the fight here!](https://forms.gle/HNMHCJ5N5XoV35Y27)  

- üñºÔ∏è **Art(ist) Archive! **We‚Äôve got some character art needs in the pipeline (don‚Äôt we always?), and we‚Äôd love to have even more artists on tap for when that gets firmed up‚Äîmonsterfucking tendencies appreciated but not required.
