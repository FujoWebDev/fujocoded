A screenshot event listing for CitrusCon titled "Working Together in a Dying World".

The host is Ms Boba (she/her) from FujoCoded over Zoom and it runs 1:30PM - 2:30PM Eastern Timezone.

The description is "There's no denying it: shit's fucked. From the internet to the world at large—and even within our own communities—it feels like everything’s falling apart. If we're going to make it through, we'll have to do what every ragtag team must: learn to work together. But how do you do that when everything already feels too much?"
