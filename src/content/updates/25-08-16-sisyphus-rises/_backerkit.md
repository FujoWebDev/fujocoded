title: "New Ones Come in Pairs: NPM Articles, Patreon Tiers (& Catboys)"
---

<span class="text-xl text-fujo-pink">Greetings, _fu(jo|dan|jin)_ and friends,
<br/></span>
It's been a busy busy time in the Fujoverse: plenty of lessons learned, cool
stuff sent out (and preparing to be sent), plus new [learn@
articles](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/) written—and how could we forget the
catboys?

Let's dive right in!


## FujoCoded General Company News

- **Buy Our Love:** We have not one, but [TWO new Patreon
  tiers](https://www.patreon.com/join/fujocoded): **"Supporter Georg”**, because
  someone asked to give $100, and **“You Fund Me(ette)?”**, because we had to
  make a $50 one too, just for good measure\! We’re running out of names though
  so don’t ask us for $200… unless? 👀 (if you can't find them, just keep going
  right 😜)
- **Lemon-stealing Applause \#1:** Ms Boba’s CitrusCon talk “Working Together in
  a Dying World” debuted to raving reviews. If you want to ~~hear~~ read about
  toxic collaboration triangles, and toxic triangular villains, you can find the
  slides here (XXX), and various related works on AO3, we’re sure.

- **That’s How the Cookie Crumbles:** Our [Fandom
  Cookies](https://store.fujocoded.com/) are all mailed out and no longer
  threaten to crush Ms Boba in a devastating, if hilarious, avalanche—which
  means people have already been stuffing their mouths with delicious treats\!
  And also the cookies. Thanks to
  [Linky](https://blorbo.social/@linky/114880930048195252) and an Anonymous
  Supporter for the promo pics\!

- **Here’s Some We Made Earlier:** If that’s not enough, [the Digital Cookie
  Pack](https://store.fujocoded.com/products/other/fandom-cookies-digital-items-pack)
  is also nearly ready and we’ve hired Hyena, also featured in our campaign art,
  to make some delicious cookie-themed wallpapers using both their immensurate
  visual skills _and_ [our CSS wallpaper
  maker](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/wallpaper-maker).

- **Getting Our Teaching Degree:** Speaking of the [Digital Cookie
  Pack](https://store.fujocoded.com/products/other/fandom-cookies-digital-items-pack)**,**
  we’re _also_ working on the JS/HTML/CSS learn-along which is going steady, but
  taught us that even our multitasking has limits… at least when it comes to
  deadlines. Next time, only “basic” _or_ “fancy” code in our learn-alongs, not
  both\!

- **Planning for Success:** Q3 planning for Fujoverse is done, in the nick of
  time\! We’re going to continue hiring more people, and laying the foundations
  to keep that sustainable, so that Ms Boba no longer wakes up in a cold (or
  hot?) sweat thinking about TypeScript. You can read about the NPM outsourcing
  [below](#FujoCoded-BackerKit-Fulfillment-Progress:-Recent) or simply gaze at
  one of Ms Boba’s humungous project management charts in equal awe and fear\!
  If you’d like to be confronted by one of those monstrosities (and paid for
  your service), drop a card below\!

## FujoCoded Backerkit Update

### FujoCoded BackerKit Fulfillment Progress: Recent

- **NPMployees:** We landed our first articles—that you paid for\!—written by
  someone _other_ than Ms Boba and learned a lot from the process\! Such as
  “_Wow, this stuff costs money_” and “_Huh, other people write differently to me_”.
  Even with these obstacles our hired writers knocked it out of the park. You
  can find the fruits of their labour [in the newest “JavaScript beyond the
  Browser” section](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/) of learn@fujoweb.dev\!

  ![file:](./images/npm-exercise.png)

- **Feeding Frenzy:** We’ve also learned that _holy hell_, fans tasked with
  “simply uploading” new article drafts on our learning site will instead rip
  them apart like piranhas on a cow, and rebuild them better like… piranha
  scientists on a cyborg cow. Unlike this simile, the final articles came out
  great\! Next time, we’ll save time and effort by _intentionally_ channeling
  this energy, perhaps into some kind of FujoBeam.

- **Barely Beginners:** We also got some great feedback about our terminology:
  turns out a lotta people read “beginners” to mean “Starting from scratch”
  rather than our “ankle-deep and wanting more”. With this in mind, we’re gonna
  look over our messaging for learn@ and beyond, so we can fujo-snipe our main
  targets into coding forces of ~~nature~~ yaoi\!

- **A Need for NPM:** Finally, our NPM articles had a bit of a mid-creation
  crisis—they’re useful, but it’s not always obvious why, especially to
  ~~beginners~~ _hobbyists_. Next month, we’re taking them out to buy a
  motorbike and hook them up with Astro so that _you_ can shoot for the stars.
  More below\!

### FujoCoded BackerKit Fulfillment Progress: Future

- **Dressing to Impress:** One of our article writers,
  [Rie](https://notavodkashot.carrd.co/), gave us some excellent post-delivery
  advice like how to do “better storytelling” and “stricter content guidelines”,
  which they claim are “important”. We’ll be evolving the style guide in
  preparation for our next learn@ releases\!

- **Shooting for the Stars:** To showcase NPM’s learning value, we’re gonna be
  tying our NPM articles closer to Astro like it’s a 3-legged race\! We’re still
  figuring out how, but we’ll keep you all updated—nay, _involved_: we’ll be
  gathering feedback _live_ from _you_ on stream*\!* Join our “learn@ planning,
  Astro edition” [Twitch stream](http://twitch.tv/essentialrandomness) on
  \[TBD\]\!


## Around the FujoVerse

### In the press

- **~~Seeing~~ Talking Double:** Hot off the tails of her newest Citrus Con
  talk, Ms Boba jumped straight into the DashCon 2 ball pit to give last year’s
  again. Check out [the new “Rebuilding Community on the FujoWeb”
  recording](TODO) to hear about how shit’s, well, _still pretty fucked_ in the
  “running social media platforms” world. Now featuring Cohost’s runner's own
  testimonial.
- **Writing Triple:** If _watching_ is not your cup of (git)tea, the third and
  last part of “Rebuilding Community on the FujoWeb” is also all yours for
  _reading_\! Continue from where you left off to [learn more about the journey
  ahead](TODO), or start back from the beginning [to understand how we got here](TODO)
  (and how we might get out).
- **Boards Love Cameo:** Our FujoBoards got even more web-famous this month
  after they were featured on esteemed-BL-manga-publisher Seven Seas
  Entertainment’s [own Twitter
  account](https://x.com/fujoc0ded/status/1952809772983755012). "Senpai noticed us"
  ...and bought our wares (and hearts).

### In the (git)hub

- **Plugged In:** a [new Astro ~~plugin~~
  Integration](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/fujocoded-plugins/tree/main/astro-dev-only)
  has landed\! `@fujocoded/astro-dev-only` lets you hide any page of your Astro
  sites from the prying eyes of visitors, making them only available during
  development\! Big power, big JavaScript crimes.
- **Wall Pa(m)pered:** our [“HTML\&CSS Wallpaper
  Maker”](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/wallpaper-maker) got an upgrade\! With
  our memory of its inner workings dusted off for our Fortune Cookies wallpapers
  (soon in our digital pack\!), we’ve released our “internal upgrades” for
  everyone to enjoy: _you too_ can now import HTML snippets across multiple
  wallpapers. **What better way to practice your HTML & CSS?** Make some, and
  share them with us!
- **Long Staffed:** `@bobaboard/ao3.js` got a _tiny bit_ more powerful
  thanks to _a_ short-but-mighty external contribution: our friend
  Gingerchew—_thank you\!_—added built-in support for short “ao3.org” links\!
  Want to help us develop even more features? [Open or grab an
  issue](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/AO3.js/issues), or be a “pinch-hitter” for [one
  of our open
  PRs](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/AO3.js/pulls?q=is:open+is:pr+label:%22%E2%9A%BE+Needs+Pinch+Hitter%22)**.**
  All skill levels are welcome\!

### Ms Boba Streaming Schedule

We’re coming back (with a vengeance) to our double-feature Monday+Thursdays
schedule\*\*, so that we can knock [the
guestbook](https://github.com/fujowebdev/lexicon-guestbook) ~~up~~ out in record
time. As usual, see you [at 3PM(_ish!!_) Pacific on
Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/essentialrandomness) for our coding adventures.

More importantly: this increased schedule means space for some _special edition_
streams. This month, we’re inviting everyone interested to come **outline the
future “Astro” section of our [learn@ website](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/)**,
together! What should our new articles cover? How will they intersect with the
NPM ones we’re already planning?

Join us on \[date tbd\], and let’s discuss\!

## We Are Hiring!


## That's all, folks!

And with that, our August update is finished! See ya next month ([and on
Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/essentialrandomness)) for more adventures
together!

Love,<br /> The FujoCoded Team _(A Confluence of Calamities)_
