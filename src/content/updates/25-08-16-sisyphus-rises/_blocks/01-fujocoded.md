## FujoCoded General Company News

- **Buy Our Love:** We have not one, but [TWO new Patreon
  tiers](https://www.patreon.com/join/fujocoded): **"Supporter Georg”**, because
  someone asked to give $100, and **“You Fund Me(ette)?”**, because we had to
  make a $50 one too, just for good measure\! We’re running out of names though
  so don’t ask us for $200… unless? 👀 (if you can't [find them on
  Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/join/fujocoded), just keep clicking to the
  right 😜)
- **Lemon-stealing Applause \#1:** Ms Boba’s CitrusCon talk **“Working Together in
  a Dying World”debuted to raving reviews.** If you want to ~~hear~~ read about
  toxic collaboration triangles, and toxic triangular villains, [you can find
  the slides here](https://essentialrandomness.com/working-together) and
  various thematically-related works on AO3, we’re sure.

- **That’s How the Cookie Crumbles:** Our [Fandom
  Cookies](https://store.fujocoded.com/) are all mailed out and no longer
  threaten to crush Ms Boba in a devastating, if hilarious, avalanche—which
  means people have already been stuffing their mouths with delicious treats\!
  And also the cookies. Thanks to
  [Linky](https://blorbo.social/@linky/114880930048195252) and an Anonymous
  Supporter for the promo pics\!

- **Here’s Some We Made Earlier:** If that’s not enough, **[the Digital Cookie
  Pack](https://store.fujocoded.com/products/other/fandom-cookies-digital-items-pack)
  is also nearly ready** and we’ve hired
  [Hyena](https://fluffyhyena.neocities.org/), also featured in our promotional
  art, to make some delicious cookie-themed wallpapers using both their
  immensurate visual skills _and_ [our CSS wallpaper
  maker](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/wallpaper-maker).

- **Getting Our Teaching Degree:** Speaking of the [Digital Cookie
  Pack](https://store.fujocoded.com/products/other/fandom-cookies-digital-items-pack)**,**
  we’re _also_ working on the JS/HTML/CSS learn-along which is going steady, but
  taught us that even our multitasking has limits… at least when it comes to
  deadlines. Next time, only “basic” _or_ “fancy” code in our learn-alongs, not
  both!

- **Planning for Success:** Q3 planning for Fujoverse is done, in the nick of
  time\! We’re going to continue hiring more people, and laying the foundations
  to keep that sustainable, so that Ms Boba no longer wakes up in a cold (or
  hot?) sweat thinking about TypeScript. You can read about the NPM outsourcing
  [below](#FujoCoded-BackerKit-Fulfillment-Progress:-Recent) or simply gaze at
  one of Ms Boba’s humungous project management charts in equal awe and fear\!

  If you’d like to be confronted by one of those monstrosities (and paid for
  your service), [drop a card below](#we-are-hiring)!
