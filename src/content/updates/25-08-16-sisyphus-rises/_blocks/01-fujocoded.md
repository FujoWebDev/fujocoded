## FujoCoded General Company News

- **Buy Our Love:** We have not one, but [TWO new Patreon
  tiers](https://www.patreon.com/join/fujocoded): **"Supporter Georg‚Äù**, because
  someone asked to give us $100, and **‚ÄúYou Fund Me(ette)?‚Äù**, because we had to
  make a $50 one too, just for good measure\! We‚Äôre running out of names though
  so don‚Äôt ask us for $200‚Ä¶ unless? üëÄ (if you can't [find them on
  Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/join/fujocoded), just keep clicking to the
  right üòú)
- **Lemon-stealing Applause:** Ms Boba‚Äôs CitrusCon talk **‚ÄúWorking Together in
  a Dying World‚Äùdebuted to raving reviews.** If you want to ~~hear~~ read about
  toxic collaboration triangles, and toxic triangular villains, [you can find
  the slides here](https://essentialrandomness.com/working-together) and
  various thematically-related works on AO3, we‚Äôre sure.

- **That‚Äôs How the Cookie Crumbles:** **Our [Fandom
  Cookies](https://store.fujocoded.com/) are all mailed out** and no longer
  threaten to crush Ms Boba in a devastating, if hilarious, avalanche‚Äîwhich
  means people have already been stuffing their mouths with delicious treats\!
  And also the cookies. Thanks to
  [Linky](https://blorbo.social/@linky/114880930048195252) and an Anonymous
  Supporter for the promo pics\!

- **Here‚Äôs Some We Made Earlier:** If that‚Äôs not enough, **[the Digital Cookie
  Pack](https://store.fujocoded.com/products/other/fandom-cookies-digital-items-pack)
  is also nearly ready** and we‚Äôve hired
  [Hyena](https://fluffyhyena.neocities.org/), also featured in our promotional
  art, to make some delicious cookie-themed wallpapers using both their
  immensurate visual skills _and_ [our CSS wallpaper
  maker](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/wallpaper-maker).

- **Getting Our Teaching Degree:** Speaking of the [Digital Cookie
  Pack](https://store.fujocoded.com/products/other/fandom-cookies-digital-items-pack)**,**
  **we‚Äôre _also_ working on [the promised JS/HTML/CSS
  learn-along](https://store.fujocoded.com/products/other/fandom-cookies-digital-items-pack).**
  It is going steady, but ut taught us that even our multitasking has limits‚Ä¶ at
  least when it comes to deadlines. Next time, only a ‚Äúbasic" _or_ ‚Äúfancy" code
  version in our learn-alongs, not both!

- **Planning for Success:** Q3 planning for Fujoverse is done, in the nick of
  time\! **We‚Äôre going to continue hiring more people, and laying the
  foundations to make our work sustainable**, so that Ms Boba no longer wakes up
  in a cold (or hot?) sweat thinking about (teaching) TypeScript. You can read
  [about our NPM articles outsourcing
  below](#FujoCoded-BackerKit-Fulfillment-Progress:-Recent) or simply gaze at
  one of Ms Boba‚Äôs humungous project management charts in equal awe and fear\!

  If you‚Äôd like to be confronted by one of those monstrosities (and paid for
  your service), [drop your card in the hiring section below](#we-are-hiring)!
