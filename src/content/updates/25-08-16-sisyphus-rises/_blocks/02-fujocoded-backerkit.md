## FujoCoded Backerkit Update

### FujoCoded BackerKit Fulfillment Progress: Recent

- **NPMployees:** **We landed our first articles**—that you paid for\!—**written by
  someone _other_ than Ms Boba**, and learned a lot from the process\! Such as
  “_Wow, this stuff costs money_” and “_Huh, other people write differently to me_”.
  Even with these obstacles our hired writers knocked it out of the park. You
  can find the fruits of their labour [in the new “JavaScript beyond the
  Browser” section](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/) of learn@<span>fujoweb.dev</span>\!

- **Feeding Frenzy:** We’ve also learned that _holy hell_, **fans tasked with
  “just uploading” new article drafts on our learning site will instead rip
  them apart** like piranhas on a cow, and rebuild them better like… piranha
  scientists on a cyborg cow. Unlike this simile, the final articles came out
  great\! Next time, we’ll save time and effort by _intentionally_ channeling
  this energy, perhaps into some kind of prose-editing FujoBeam.

- **Barely Beginners:** We also got some great feedback about our terminology:
  turns out a lotta people read “beginners” to mean “Starting from scratch”
  rather than our “Ankle-deep and wanting more”. With this in mind, **we’re gonna
  work on improving our messaging for learn@ and beyond**, so we can
  fujo-snipe our main targets into coding forces of ~~nature~~ yaoi\!

- **A Need for NPM:** Finally, our new content had a bit of a mid-creation
  crisis—**the NPM articles are useful, but it’s not always clear where they
  _fit_,** especially to ~~beginners~~ hobbyists. Next up, we’re taking them out
  to buy a motorbike and hooking them up with Astro, so that together you _all_
  can shoot for the stars. [More below\!](#fujocoded-backerkit-fulfillment-progress-future)

### FujoCoded BackerKit Fulfillment Progress: Future

- **Dressing to Impress:** **One of our writers**,
  [Rie](https://notavodkashot.carrd.co/), **gave us some excellent
  post-article-delivery advice**, like how to do “better storytelling” and
  "clearer content guidelines”, which they claim are “important”. Under their
  guidance, we’ll be evolving the style guide in preparation for our next learn@
  releases\!

- **Shooting for the Stars:** As mentioned, we plan to showcase NPM’s learning
  value by tying it closer to Astro like it’s a 3-legged race\! We’re still
  working on the details, but we’ll keep you all updated—nay, _involved_: **next
  week, we’ll be gathering feedback _live_ from _you_ on stream\*\!** Join our
  “Learning Path Plan-Along (Astro edition)” [Twitch
  stream](http://twitch.tv/essentialrandomness) on Monday, September 1st, 2PM
  Pacific!
