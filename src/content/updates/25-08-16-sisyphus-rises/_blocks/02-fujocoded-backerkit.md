## FujoCoded Backerkit Update

### FujoCoded BackerKit Fulfillment Progress: Recent

- **NPMployees:** We landed our first articles—that you paid for\!—written by
  someone _other_ than Ms Boba and learned a lot from the process\! Such as
  “_Wow, this stuff costs money_” and “_Huh, other people write differently to me_”.
  Even with these obstacles our hired writers knocked it out of the park. You
  can find the fruits of their labour [in the newest “JavaScript beyond the
  Browser” section](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/) of learn@fujoweb.dev\!

- **Feeding Frenzy:** We’ve also learned that _holy hell_, fans tasked with
  “simply uploading” new article drafts on our learning site will instead rip
  them apart like piranhas on a cow, and rebuild them better like… piranha
  scientists on a cyborg cow. Unlike this simile, the final articles came out
  great\! Next time, we’ll save time and effort by _intentionally_ channeling
  this energy, perhaps into some kind of FujoBeam.

- **Barely Beginners:** We also got some great feedback about our terminology:
  turns out a lotta people read “beginners” to mean “Starting from scratch”
  rather than our “ankle-deep and wanting more”. With this in mind, we’re gonna
  look over our messaging for learn@ and beyond, so we can fujo-snipe our main
  targets into coding forces of ~~nature~~ yaoi\!

- **A Need for NPM:** Finally, our NPM articles had a bit of a mid-creation
  crisis—they’re useful, but it’s not always obvious why, especially to
  ~~beginners~~ _hobbyists_. Next month, we’re taking them out to buy a
  motorbike and hook them up with Astro so that _you_ can shoot for the stars.

### FujoCoded BackerKit Fulfillment Progress: Future

- **Dressing to Impress:** One of our article writers,
  [Rie](https://notavodkashot.carrd.co/), gave us some excellent post-delivery
  advice like how to do “better storytelling” and “stricter content guidelines”,
  which they claim are “important”. We’ll be evolving the style guide in
  preparation for our next learn@ releases\!

- **Shooting for the Stars:** To showcase NPM’s learning value, we’re gonna be
  tying our NPM articles closer to Astro like it’s a 3-legged race\! We’re still
  figuring out how, but we’ll keep you all updated—nay, _involved_: we’ll be
  gathering feedback _live_ from _you_ on stream*\!* Join our “learn@ planning,
  Astro edition” [Twitch stream](http://twitch.tv/essentialrandomness) on
