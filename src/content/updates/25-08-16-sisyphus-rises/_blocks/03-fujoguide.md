## The Fujoshi Guide to Web Development

### Recent Progress on the FujoGuide

- **Git Ready for Badges:** Weâ€™ve had one, yes, but what about a _second_ badge?
  **Coming in hot with a cute new badge for our lovely backers**, courtesy of
  [touchofstatic](https://github.com/touchofstatic). Just like the old badge
  backers will find it in their rewards folder; but unlike [the old one](#whats-next-for-fujoguide), this
  will remain a Kickstarter Exclusive! (Lost your rewards folder?
  Check out the email to follow\!)

- **Catboy Convergence:** The new catboys are here\! Having gone through the
  final adoption process for â€˜em, **[Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) and
  [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/)'s pedigree certificates**â€”their
  behind-the-scenes files, that isâ€”**will soon be in our Kickstarter backers and
  [Patreon $upporters](https://www.patreon.com/fujocoded)â€™s inboxes**, right
  after you read this\! Hopefully fully vaccinated and neutered, though theyâ€™re
  not happy about that last one. Huge thanks to
  [brokemycrown](https://www.fujoweb.dev/team/brokemycrown) for another two hot
  catboys hot off the art presses, they look great\!

- **Teasing Tails:** No money for the behind the scenes? Have a tease: **twins
  Gitea and Forgejo used to be so close you could hardly tell them apart.**
  Unfortunately, since [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) (left) created his own
  companyâ€”whether to chase sustainability (he says), or to seek big daddy
  Microsoftâ€™s approval ([Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) says)â€”heâ€™s now become
  _insufferable_. He even started wearing a beret\! Yet, in their own way, they
  both still strive to bring independent Version Control to the masses, even if
  they squabble likeâ€¦well, two cat(boy)s.

- **Pre-sale and Pre-view:** This month, we updated our store to support selling
  unlisted, direct-link-only items (ðŸ‘€), which means **FujoGuide Issue 1 Preview**
  (the one folks got in their Kickstarter rewards) **is now on saleâ€¦ if you know
  where to get it.** We already had our first chances to give it out, so we can
  confirm the sales are sailing, with a few bugs still to squash\!

### What's Next for FujoGuide

- **Ye Olde Badge:** And speaking of FujoGuide sales. Remember the old Git badge
  (ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘€) we sent our backers? With the new [_Kickstarter exclusive_
  one](#recent-progress-on-the-fujoguide) _finally_ ready,itâ€™s time to share
  that one more broadly with everyone who buys (and bought) our Git zine\! **If
  youâ€™re among the current acquirers, youâ€™ll soon get an email with your
  updated zine, badge included.** And if youâ€™re among our backersâ€¦ go check back
  in your rewards folder, itâ€™s already there\!

- **The Beta-verse:** While weâ€™ve had to channel all our teaching energy into
  [the Fandom Cookies
  Learn-along](https://store.fujocoded.com/products/other/fandom-cookies-digital-items-pack),
  **we pinky-promise to have an update on the GitHub Zine beta by the next
  newsletter.** Thank you everyone for your patienceâ€”in the meantime,
  look forward to getting the new badges and character sheets into your hands\!
