## The Fujoshi Guide to Web Development

### Recent Progress on the FujoGuide

- **Git Ready for Badges:** Weâ€™ve had one, yes, but what about a _second_ badge?
  Weâ€™re coming in hot with a cute new badge for our lovely backers\! Just like
  the old badge youâ€™ll find it in your rewards folder; but unlike the old one,
  this will remain a Kickstarter Exclusive. (Lost your rewards folder? Check out
  the email to follow\!)

- **Catboy Convergence:** The new catboys are here\!Having gone through the
  final adoption process for â€˜em, their pedigree certificates will be in our
  Kickstarter backers and Patreon $upportersâ€™s inboxes right after you read
  this\! Hopefully fully vaccinated and neutered, though theyâ€™re not happy about
  that last one. Huge thanks to
  [brokemycrown](https://www.fujoweb.dev/team/brokemycrown) for another two hot
  catboys hot off the art presses, they look great\!

- **Teasing Tails:** No money for the behind the scenes? Have a tease: twins
  Gitea and Forgejo used to be so close it was impossible to even tell them
  apart. Unfortunately, since Gitea (left) created his own for-profit
  companyâ€”whether to chase sustainability (he says), or to seek big daddy
  Microsoftâ€™s approval (Forgejo says)â€”heâ€™s now become truly insufferable. He
  even started wearing a beret\! Yet, they both still strive to bring
  independent version control to the masses, even if they squabble likeâ€¦well,
  two cat(boy)s.

- **Pre-sale and Pre-view:** Behind the scenes, weâ€™ve been updating our store to
  supportunlisted, direct-link-only items (ðŸ‘€), which means FujoGuide Issue 1
  Preview (the one folks got in their Kickstarter rewards) is now be on saleâ€¦
  although exclusively for those who know where to get it. We already had our
  first chances to give it out, so we can confirm the sales are sailingâ€¦with a
  few bugs to squash\!

- **Ye Olde Badge:** And speaking of saleâ€¦ Remember the old Git badge (ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘€) we
  mentioned? With the new _Kickstarter exclusive_ one finally ready, as we
  promised a long time ago, itâ€™s finally time to share this one more broadly
  with everyone whoâ€™s bought our Git zine\! If youâ€™re among the exclusive
  acquirers, youâ€™ll soon get an email with your updated zine, badge included.
  And if youâ€™re among our backersâ€¦ go check back in your rewards folder, itâ€™s
  already there\!

### What's Next for FujoGuide

- **The Beta-verse:** While weâ€™ve been channeling all our teaching energy into
  the Fandom Cookies Learn-along, weâ€™re shooting to have an update on the GitHub
  beta by the next newsletter. Thank you everyone for your patience, and weâ€™re
  looking forward to getting the badges and character sheets into your hands\!
