## Around the FujoVerse

### In the press

- **~~Seeing~~ Talking Double:** Hot off the tails of her newest Citrus Con
  talk, Ms Boba jumped straight into the DashCon 2 ball pit to give last year‚Äôs
  again. Check out [the new ‚ÄúRebuilding Community on the FujoWeb‚Äù
  recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glAHIjtmYmk) to hear about how
  shit‚Äôs, well, _still pretty fucked_ in the ‚Äúrunning social media platforms‚Äù
  world. Now featuring Cohost‚Äôs runner's own testimonial.
- **Writing Triple:** If _watching_ is not your cup of (git)tea, the third and
  last part of ‚ÄúRebuilding Community on the FujoWeb‚Äù is also all yours for
  _reading_\! Continue from where you left off to [learn more about the journey
  ahead](TODO), or start back from the beginning [to understand how we got
  here](TODO) (and how we might get out).
- **Boards Love Cameo:** Our FujoBoards got even more web-famous this month
  after they were featured on esteemed-BL-manga-publisher Seven Seas
  Entertainment‚Äôs [own Twitter
  account](https://x.com/fujoc0ded/status/1952809772983755012). "Senpai noticed
  us‚Äî" (and our wares, and our hearts).

### In the (git)hub

- **Plugged In:** a [new Astro ~~plugin~~
  Integration](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/fujocoded-plugins/tree/main/astro-dev-only)
  has landed\! `@fujocoded/astro-dev-only` lets you hide any page of your Astro
  sites from the prying eyes of visitors, making them only available during
  development\! Big power, big JavaScript crimes.
- **Wall Pa(m)pered:** our [‚ÄúHTML\&CSS Wallpaper
  Maker‚Äù](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/wallpaper-maker) got an upgrade\! With
  our memory of its inner workings dusted off for our Fortune Cookies wallpapers
  ([soon in our digital pack!](https://store.fujocoded.com/products/other/fandom-cookies-digital-items-pack)), we‚Äôve released our ‚Äúinternal upgrades‚Äù for
  everyone to enjoy: _you too_ can now import HTML snippets across multiple
  wallpapers. **What better way to practice your HTML & CSS?** Make some, and
  share them with us!
- **Long Staffed:** `@bobaboard/ao3.js` got a _tiny bit_ more powerful thanks to
  _a_ short-but-mighty external contribution: [our friend
  Gingerchew](https://queer.party/@gingerchew)‚Äî_thank you\!_‚Äîadded built-in
  support for short ‚Äúao3.org‚Äù links\! Want to help us develop even more
  features? [Open or grab an
  issue](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/AO3.js/issues), or be a ‚Äúpinch-hitter‚Äù
  for [one of our open
  PRs](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/AO3.js/pulls?q=is:open+is:pr+label:%22%E2%9A%BE+Needs+Pinch+Hitter%22)**.**
  All skill levels are welcome\!

### Ms Boba Streaming Schedule

We‚Äôre coming back (with a vengeance) to our double-feature Monday+Thursdays
schedule\*\*, so that we can knock [the
guestbook](https://github.com/fujowebdev/lexicon-guestbook) ~~up~~ out in record
time. As usual, see you [at 3PM(_ish!!_) Pacific on
Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/essentialrandomness) for our coding adventures.

More importantly: this increased schedule means space for some _special edition_
streams. This month, we‚Äôre inviting everyone interested to come **outline the
future ‚ÄúAstro‚Äù section of our [learn@ website](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/)**,
together! What should our new articles cover? How will they intersect with the
NPM ones we‚Äôre already planning?

Join us on \[date tbd\], and let‚Äôs discuss\!

## We Are Hiring!

It remains true, month after month: writers, coders, and artists are _always_
welcome to submit their business cards via our [Business Cards Drop-off
Forms](https://fujocoded.com/hiring)! As we get more opportunities for (small)
gigs, we always consider our current contacts as well as new ones.

With this preamble, welcome to the special contracting opportunities we're
hiring for at this time üëá

- **üí∞Digital Relea$e:** Are you a hype-generating machine? Do you know how to
  make online dwellers' hearts go _doki doki_? **Help us create a release plan
  for [our upcoming Digital
  Pack](https://store.fujocoded.com/products/other/fandom-cookies-digital-items-pack)!**
  You won't have to do _everything_ yourself, but this task involves helping us
  think through (and writing some) content to land this release across our
  different channels...and getting people to share our joy (and, hopefully,
  their money)!
- üí∞**WRITEME.md:** Do you like writing? Do you like (some light) coding? Do you
  like using pre-made libraries, maybe even _Astro integrations_, to (as they
  say) "supercharge" your coding powers,? **Come explain to others how to use
  our code by writing [the `README.md`
  files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)
  for our repositories!** First step: our WIP [`@fujocoded/authproto`
  integration](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/fujocoded-plugins/tree/main/astro-authproto)
  for adding ATproto authentication to Astro sites!

**[New] Wish to express special interest for these currently-open
opportunities?** Does one _just call_ to you at the _perfect_ time, but you
already filled [our usual forms](https://fujocoded.com/hiring) (or they aren't
quite right)? [Use our **new, expedited** "Hiring Right Now"
form!](https://forms.gle/xQtKhiT9E1KEsn9c6) to more quickly let us know you'd be
a perfect match.
