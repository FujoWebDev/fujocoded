## Around the FujoVerse

### In the press

- **~~Seeing~~ Talking Double:** Hot off the tails of her newest Citrus Con
  talk, Ms Boba jumped straight into the DashCon 2 ball pit to give last year’s
  again. Check out [the new “Rebuilding Community on the FujoWeb”
  recording](TODO) to hear about how shit’s, well, _still pretty fucked_ in the
  “running social media platforms” world. Now featuring Cohost’s runner's own
  testimonial.
- **Writing Triple:** If _watching_ is not your cup of (git)tea, the third and
  last part of “Rebuilding Community on the FujoWeb” is also all yours for
  _reading_\! Continue from where you left off to [learn more about the journey
  ahead](TODO), or start back from the beginning [to understand how we got here](TODO)
  (and how we might get out).
- **Boards Love Cameo:** Our FujoBoards got even more web-famous this month
  after they were featured on esteemed-BL-manga-publisher Seven Seas
  Entertainment’s [own Twitter
  account](https://x.com/fujoc0ded/status/1952809772983755012). "Senpai noticed us"
  ...and bought our wares (and hearts).

### In the (git)hub

- **Plugged In:** a [new Astro ~~plugin~~
  Integration](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/fujocoded-plugins/tree/main/astro-dev-only)
  has landed\! `@fujocoded/astro-dev-only` lets you hide any page of your Astro
  sites from the prying eyes of visitors, making them only available during
  development\! Big power, big JavaScript crimes.
- **Wall Pa(m)pered:** our [“HTML\&CSS Wallpaper
  Maker”](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/wallpaper-maker) got an upgrade\! With
  our memory of its inner workings dusted off for our Fortune Cookies wallpapers
  (soon in our digital pack\!), we’ve released our “internal upgrades” for
  everyone to enjoy: _you too_ can now import HTML snippets across multiple
  wallpapers. **What better way to practice your HTML & CSS?** Make some, and
  share them with us!
- **Long Staffed:** `@bobaboard/ao3.js` got a _tiny bit_ more powerful
  thanks to _a_ short-but-mighty external contribution: our friend
  Gingerchew—_thank you\!_—added built-in support for short “ao3.org” links\!
  Want to help us develop even more features? [Open or grab an
  issue](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/AO3.js/issues), or be a “pinch-hitter” for [one
  of our open
  PRs](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/AO3.js/pulls?q=is:open+is:pr+label:%22%E2%9A%BE+Needs+Pinch+Hitter%22)**.**
  All skill levels are welcome\!

### Ms Boba Streaming Schedule

We’re coming back (with a vengeance) to our double-feature Monday+Thursdays
schedule\*\*, so that we can knock [the
guestbook](https://github.com/fujowebdev/lexicon-guestbook) ~~up~~ out in record
time. As usual, see you [at 3PM(_ish!!_) Pacific on
Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/essentialrandomness) for our coding adventures.

More importantly: this increased schedule means space for some _special edition_
streams. This month, we’re inviting everyone interested to come **outline the
future “Astro” section of our [learn@ website](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/)**,
together! What should our new articles cover? How will they intersect with the
NPM ones we’re already planning?

Join us on \[date tbd\], and let’s discuss\!
