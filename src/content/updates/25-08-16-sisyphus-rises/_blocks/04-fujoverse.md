## Around the FujoVerse

### In the press

- **~~Seeing~~ Talking Double:** Hot off the tails of [this year's Citrus Con
  talk](#fujocoded-general-company-news), Ms Boba jumped straight into the
  [DashCon 2](https://www.dashcontwo.com/) ball pit to give last year‚Äôs again.
  **Check out [the ‚ÄúRebuilding Community on the FujoWeb‚Äù
  re-recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glAHIjtmYmk)** to hear how
  shit‚Äôs, well, _still pretty fucked_ in the ‚Äúrunning social media platforms‚Äù
  world‚Äîor, if you prefer, just her dispassionate rambling in the final Q&A.
- **Writing Triple:** If _watching_ is not your cup of (git)tea, **the third and
  last part of ‚ÄúRebuilding Community on the FujoWeb‚Äù is also all yours for
  _reading_\!** [Continue from where you left
  off](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/posts/rebuilding-community-on-the-web/part-3)
  to learn more about the journey ahead, or [start back from the
  beginning](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/posts/rebuilding-community-on-the-web/part-1)
  to understand how we got here and how we (might) get out.
- **Boards-Love Cameo:** Our FujoBoards got even more web-famous this month
  after they were featured on [esteemed-BL-manga-publisher Seven Seas
  Entertainment](https://x.com/fujoc0ded/status/1952809772983755012)‚Äôs own Twitter
  account. As they say, "Senpai noticed
  us~" (and ~~stole our hearts~~ [bought our boards](https://fujoboard.com/)).

### In the (git)hub

- **Plugged In:** A new Astro ~~plugin~~ Integration has landed\!
  **[`@fujocoded/astro-dev-only` lets you hide any page of your Astro
  website](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/fujocoded-plugins/tree/main/astro-dev-only)
  from the prying eyes of visitors**, making them only available during
  development\! Big power, big JavaScript crimes.
- **Wall Pa(m)pered:** Our [‚ÄúHTML\&CSS Wallpaper
  Maker‚Äù](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/wallpaper-maker) got an upgrade\! The
  Fortune Cookies wallpapers ([soon in our digital
  pack!](https://store.fujocoded.com/products/other/fandom-cookies-digital-items-pack))
  dusted off our memory of its inner workings, which means we‚Äôve
  released our ‚Äúinternal upgrades‚Äù for everyone to enjoy. **_You too_ can now
  create HTML snippets to reuse multiple wallpapers.** What better way to practice
  your HTML & CSS? Make some wallpapers, and share them with us on socials!
- **Long Staffed:** [`@bobaboard/ao3.js` got a _tiny bit_ more
  powerful](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/AO3.js) thanks to _a_ short-but-mighty
  external contribution: **[our friend
  Gingerchew](https://queer.party/@gingerchew)‚Äî_thank you\!_‚Äîadded built-in
  support for short ‚Äúao3.org‚Äù links\!** If you wish to follow in their
  footsteps, we'd love to help you [open or grab an
  issue](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/AO3.js/issues), or be a ‚Äúpinch-hitter‚Äù
  for [an open
  Pull Request](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/AO3.js/pulls?q=is:open+is:pr+label:%22%E2%9A%BE+Needs+Pinch+Hitter%22)**.**
  All skill levels are welcome\!

### Ms Boba Streaming Schedule

To knock [our ATproto
guestbook](https://github.com/fujowebdev/lexicon-guestbook) ~~up~~ out in record
time, **we‚Äôre back (with a vengeance) to our double-feature Monday+Thursdays
schedule**. As always, join our coding adventures [on
Twitch at 3PM Pacific](https://www.twitch.tv/essentialrandomness)_...ish._ We may be on
air more often, but not always more _on time_ üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è!

More importantly: the increased schedule once again leaves us space for some
_special edition_ streams. This time, **we‚Äôre _inviting_ everyone to come
brainstorm the future [Astro section](https://astro.build/) of our [learn@
website](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/) with us**!

What should our new articles cover? How will they intersect with our NPM ones?
Let's _ALL_ find out during our [‚ÄúLearning Path Plan-Along (Astro edition)‚Äù Twitch
stream](http://twitch.tv/essentialrandomness) on Monday, September 1st, 2PM
Pacific!

## We Are Hiring!

It remains true, month after month: **writers, coders, and artists are _always_
welcome to submit their business cards via our [Business Cards Drop-off
Forms](https://fujocoded.com/hiring)**. When hiring opportunities arise, we always pull these contacts up as we search for the right candidates!

Speaking of which, welcome to the special contracting opportunities we're hiring
for at this time üëá

- **üí∞Digital Relea$e:** Are you a hype-generating machine? Do you know how to
  make online dwellers' hearts go _doki doki_? **Help us create a release plan
  for [our upcoming Digital
  Pack](https://store.fujocoded.com/products/other/fandom-cookies-digital-items-pack)!**
  While you won't have to do _everything_ yourself, we need your help thinking
  through this launch, and planning (maybe _even writing_)
  content that gets all our supporters to share _our joy_...and, hopefully,
  _their money_.
- **`üí∞WRITEME.md`:** Do you like writing? Do you like (even just some) coding?
  Do you love the idea of empowering others to, as they say, _"supercharge"
  their coding powers_ with pre-made libraries or integrations? **Come write
  [the `README.md`
  files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)
  for our repositories, and tell others how to put our code to their own use!**
  First step: [our WIP `@fujocoded/authproto`
  integration](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/fujocoded-plugins/tree/main/astro-authproto),
  which adds ATproto authentication to _any_ Astro site and lets visitors log
  in.

To express interest for these short-term opportunities, **use our [**expedited** "Hiring Right Now" form](https://forms.gle/xQtKhiT9E1KEsn9c6) to
let us know you're <u>currently available</u>, and a good match for the position.** If you don't quite
fit (and have filled out [our usual forms](https://fujocoded.com/hiring)),
we'll still look over those records to find additional candidates.
