Character art for Gitea and Forgejo gijinka designs, both by Jack @brokemycrown.
They are catboys whose ears stick out slightly from under their hats.

The Gitea design is turned to the left and looking towards Forgejo. He has
grayish hair that fades into a green color ombre and has the Gitea logo beneath
his left eye. He has the look of a longing Victorian child and wears clothes
inspired by the time period, with a jacket that clasps at the neck with lots of
ruffles and short shorts that help keep up a combo of stockings and combat
boots.

The Forgejo design is turned towards the right and he has a pouty-angry
expression. Beneath his right eye is the Forgejo icon. He has a very punk look,
with a sleeve of color block tattoos going up to his neck on his right arm, a
studded leather jacket, ripped shorts and fishnet stockings. His shirt has a
graffiti style'd forgejo icon over an empty git commit icon. He wears a black
baseball cap. His hair and tail color is a grayish-brown that turns into a
reddish ombre. His tail also has three piercings.
