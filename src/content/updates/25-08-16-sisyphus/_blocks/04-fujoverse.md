## Around the FujoVerse

### In the press

- **~~Seeing~~ Talking Double:** We had one talk, yes, but what about *second talk*? Straight off the tails of her newest Citrus Con talk, Ms Boba jumped straight into the DashCon 2 ball pit to give last year’s again. Check out the new “Rebuilding Community on the FujoWeb” recording to hear about how shit’s, well, *still pretty fucked* in the “running social media platforms” world. Now featuring Cohost’s runner's own testimonial. 

- **Writing Triple:** If *watching* is not your cup of (git)tea, the third and last part of “Rebuilding Community on the FujoWeb” is also all yours for *reading*\! Continue from where you left off to learn more about the journey ahead of us, or start back from the beginning to see the full picture.

- **Boards Love Cameo:** Our FujoBoards got even more web-famous this month after they were featured on [esteemed-BL-manga-publisher Seven Seas Entertainment’s own Twitter account](https://x.com/fujoc0ded/status/1952809772983755012). \[TODO\]

### In the (git)hub

- **Plugged In:** a [new Astro ~~plugin~~ Integration](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/fujocoded-plugins/tree/main/astro-dev-only) has landed\! `@fujocoded/astro-dev-only` lets you hide any page of your Astro sites from the prying eyes of visitors, making them only available during development\! Big power, big JavaScript crimes.  
- **Wall Pa(m)pered:** our [“HTML\&CSS Wallpaper Maker”](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/wallpaper-maker) got an upgrade\! With our memory of its inner workings dusted off for our Fortune Cookies wallpapers (soon in our digital pack\!), we’ve released our “internal upgrades” for everyone to enjoy. Now that *you too* can import HTML snippets across multiple wallpapers, what better way to learn some HTML & CSS than by making some?  
- **Long Staffed:** `@bobaboard/ao3.js` got evena *tiny bit* more powerful thanks to *a* short-but-mighty external contribution: our friend Gingerchew—*thank you\!*—added built-in support for short “ao3.org” links\! Want to help us develop even more features? [Open or grab an issue](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/AO3.js/), or be a “pinch-hitter” for [one of our open PRs](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/AO3.js/pulls?q=is:open+is:pr+label:%22%E2%9A%BE+Needs+Pinch+Hitter%22)**.** All skill levels are welcome\!

### Ms Boba Streaming Schedule

After back-to-back cons stopped us from streaming last month, we’re coming back with a vengeance and doing a double-feature Monday+Thursdays so that we can knock the guestbook ~~up~~ out in record time. 

In our latest editions, we’ve built a dedicated Astro website for people to see, post on, and even create their guestbooks\! After some light styling, we’ll now tackle important features like content deletion and moderation.

But even more importantly, this increased schedule means we now have space for some *special edition* streams. This month, we’re inviting everyone interested to come discuss and outline together the future “Astro” section of our learn@ website\! What should our new articles cover? How will they intersect with the NPM ones we’re already planning?

Join us on \[date tbd\], and let’s find out together\!
