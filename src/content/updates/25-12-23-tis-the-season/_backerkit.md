<span class="text-xl text-fujo-pink">Greetings, _fu(jo|dan|jin)_ and friends,
<br/></span> End of year celebrations are upon us, and what better way to usher them in than the unique—_and belated_ 🙇—gift of a signature FujoCoded update?

Venture down this edition for the release of our first publicly-buyable teaching product (a one-of-a-kind tour de force that truly stretched our resources), the steadfast progress on taking the [production of learn@ content](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/) off Ms Boba's tired shoulders, and the many things happening in the ever-expanding FujoVerse™\!

## FujoCoded General Company News [Omakase]

**Note**: This is a "omakase" selection of our company's updates. Enjoy the full menu [on our website](https://fujocoded.com/updates/25-08-16-sisyphus-rises).

- **Cookies Complete:** The Fandom Cookies digital pack is out at last: **[head to our store _right now_](https://store.fujocoded.com/products/other/fandom-cookies-digital-items-pack) to learn to build your own fortune generator website\!** This pack includes a ton of content, featuring a full set of wallpapers and digital goodies [from fannish artists](https://bsky.app/profile/fujocoded.bsky.social/post/3m724cmhhrk2g), alongside our HTML/CSS/JavaScript learn-along _“with heavily commented code for beginners stepping up”._ And if you buy it _now,_ **you’ll also get a discount for the ✨fancy edition✨** (for future release), which builds upon the regular pack to help you master _\~even fancier\~,_ more advanced CSS, JS, and HTML techniques.

- **Executive Release:** In the spirit of _baiting two seme with one uke_, our Digital Pack release did not just deliver _over 120_ of them, “freebies” included, **it _also_ showed us how we’d fare with a prolonged release campaign\!** Let’s just say with only one Ms Boba and many, many cookies (and threads), we did have to [crowdsource our executive function](https://bsky.app/profile/fujocoded.bsky.social/post/3m4eiw4xxh22u). Thankfully, we also engaged the socials-wrangling help of [queercatboy](http://fujocoded.com/contributors/gqueercatboy) and Elendraug. Next launch campaign challenge… FujoGuide Issue 1? 👀

- **Cleaning Up Our ~~Act~~ Mart:** With the digital pack buyers at our doors, we carved up the time—and _adrenaline_—to tidy up [the FujoCoded store](https://store.fujocoded.com/). In record time, we’ve added a ton of missing stuff like card backgrounds that help stickers pop, on-click image magnification (so you can see what you’re buying), and even made it _much, much_ faster to load\! For the animated Disney-style montage of the raccoon(girl)s working their cleaning magic, throw us a few hundred bucks and we’ll see what we can do.

## FujoCoded Backerkit Update

> **Editor's Note:** BackerKit funds helped launch learn@ by funding our Terminal and NPM series, so we'll be officially including all progress here from here on out\!

### FujoCoded BackerKit Fulfillment Progress: Recent

- **Workshopping Writers:** Our [friend and article writer Rie](https://fujocoded.com/contributors/rie) took [our existing learn@ style guide](https://community.fujocoded.com/fujowebdev/) into their own hands (and wisdom). After giving our existing guidelines a very-needed coat of polish and clarity, they used their experience to concoct a better article writing AND review process—all this so we can spread our (free) knowledge faster and more sustainably\! If that was not enough, they’re now test-driving this same process, guiding a kind volunteer in reviewing the [Terminal series you funded](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/quickstarts/terminal-quickstart/) (🙏) and upgrading it to fit our latest guidelines.

- **Amicable Divorce:** Ms Boba’s been breaking up marriages again, this time splitting up our [NPM articles](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/npm/javascript-beyond-websites-nodejs) into more focused and approachable (not to mention less scary) chunks. Hand-on exercises—like [Running NodeJS programs](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/npm/your-first-node-program/) and [Learn and Practice NPM](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/npm/npm-in-practice/)—are now cozily settled in their single-occupancy home(page)s, so you can head directly to your preferred learning avenue, or more easily link your friends to the exact skills they seek.

- **Shoot for the Stars**: Behold the outline of our [Astro learning path](https://leaflet.pub/117c41f5-52a5-4a9d-9b42-f8d4c3a6c6fe)\! As the [last newsletter](https://fujocoded.com/updates/25-08-16-sisyphus-rises) foretold, the collective hive-mind gathered forth in our [Astro stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2556015846) to ponder the missing pieces in the existing Astro docs. The verdict? While they’re excellent for people starting a website from scratch, they lack guidance for those wishing to upgrade their handcrafted sites—a significant portion of our own target audience\! We have, _alas_, not yet placed this “jump on the Astro rocket without leaving your site behind” series in our schedule, but we’re eager to start as our current articles (and other assorted obligations) wind down.

### FujoCoded BackerKit Fulfillment Progress: Future

- **NVM Extras:** We’ve had your first batch of NPM articles, yes, but what about a _second batch_? In the very first partnership of its kind, the BobaBoard Docs Bubble—aka, _sociocratic circle_—collectively drafted an installation guide for NVM—aka, _Node Version Manager_—which is our recommended avenue of getting access to NodeJS—aka, [_JavaScript but outside the Browser_](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/npm/javascript-beyond-websites-nodejs/). Next up, we’ll add this guide to learn@ to help people install NodeJS _the proper way_ by **not** installing it. A huge thank you to “The Docs”, our <em>doc</em>-torly bunch who all prefer the cover of anonymity, for their much better write-up on this complicated relationship\!

- **Governance and You:** With [community@](https://community.fujocoded.com/) up and ready, we can start filling it up with some currently-internal guides on Sociocracy, the collective governance system FujoVerse™ projects are working to adopt and evangelize. This “working in communities” learning area is also where the “Dealing with Interpersonal Conflict” article this campaign funded will live… as soon as we’ve set up our existing communities up for success, and we’re ready to tackle more writing—in both _quantity_ and _ambition_.

## Intermission — A Word _to_ our $ponsors

This update (and our ongoing work) is brought to you by our lovely Patrons\! Couldn’t keep this running without y’all—raccoons need _so much_ food, and don’t even get us started on their _unquenchable thirst for doujinshi_.

If you’ve not already boarded our _ship_, [jump on our Patreon now](https://www.patreon.com/c/fujocoded)\! Tiers start at $3/month, and give you access to coupons and—see [our FujoStore highlights](#fujostore-highlights-restocks-sales-and-limited-time-offers) below 👀—priority access to discounted or limited-edition merchandise. **You’ll soon even be able to showcase your blorbo [on a big wall](https://bobaboard.com/blorbos-wall-2022)\!**

**Did you know?** Studies show [our Patrons](https://www.patreon.com/c/fujocoded) are 30% more likely to receive long in-depth fanfiction of their rarepairs _(it’s true, we swear)_\!

## Around the FujoVerse [Omakase]

### In the Press

- **Houston, We Have a Badge**: The internet (as you know) is all about _one_ thing: making _friends_. And not only did our Astro “learning path” stream deepen our friendship with the Astro team, it directly led to the creation of [the official “Friends of Houston” badge](https://github.com/louisescher/astro-webrings/blob/master/packages/astro-webrings/src/images/friends-of-houston.gif)\! After hearing us sing the praises of Houston (Astro’s mascot and goodest robot since WALL-E), not to mention their sway with ~~the ladies~~ Static-Site-Generator-seeking _fujin_, the Astro team concocted this badge _and_ [a webring to go with it](https://astro-webrings.lou.gg/#available-webrings), so _everyone_ can now become Houston’s special friend.

### In the Git(hub)

- **Autorelease of Our Own:** As the FujoVerse™ grows, so must our ability to keep up with its pace—which means we’ve started adding _autorelease_ to our libraries\! This process automatically keeps track of code changes, builds a list of new features, and lets us quickly release new versions into the wild. You can witness our first such release on `@fujocoded/ao3.js` (formerly `@bobaboard/ao3.js`). Among the latest features: tag search, fetching work content, non-AO3 archives support, and download URLs\!

- **Astrolabe’s Blasting Off (Again):** Long-time friends may remember Astrolabe, the “universal rich text editor for multi-platform content” we’ve been chipping away at since, well…_almost_ our origins\! Now, with our ATproto connections bemoaning the need for something Astrolabe-shaped, we’re once again set on making “_fetch”_ happen: Ms Boba has been slowly publishing her private plugins, polishing the Astrolabe repo (check out the [new `README`](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/astrolabe) and [latest Storybook](https://astrolabe-editor.netlify.app/?path=/story/adapters-starter-bluesky--link-and-underline)), upgrading libraries to the latest version, and experimenting with loading posts from other socials ([like Leaflet](https://astrolabe-editor.netlify.app/?path=/story/adapters-starter-leaflet-from--base-lexicon)) or [decentralized ATproto emoji](https://astrolabe-editor.netlify.app/?path=/story/astrolabe-emoji--editable-multiple-sets%20). Alongside her, fellow BobaBoard Builders Bubble member Sel has been working on making Spoilers accessible to screen readers as he familiarizes himself with the codebase. Want to join ‘em? Read on 👀👇

![file:](./images/astrolabe.png)

- **Join the Cult:** What’s better than us adding new functionality to our open source projects? Helping _you_—yes you\!—do the same\! The BobaBoard Builders Bubble recently banded together to open contributor-friendly issues for both [AO3.js](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/ao3.js/issues) and [Astrolabe](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/astrolabe/issues), so people like _you_—yes you\!—can come show (or learn) how it’s done\! So look around, swing by, throw some code at the wall, and come ask help if lost\! These’ll look great on your resume, portfolio, _and_ Hinge profile, we swear.

## Collaborate with Us\!

Welcome to the special opportunities we’re recruiting or hiring for at this time 👇 As the new year dawns, we’ll be looking to start it on the right foot with a recurring theme: _coordination_ (of volunteers), _coordination_ (of beta readers), and _coordination_ (of tasks)\! Without further ado, check out our volunteer positions (🙏) or head straight to our paid one (💰).

- **\[🙏\] Who’ll Wrangle the Wranglers?:** Our origin project, [BobaBoard](https://bobaboard.com/), is **looking for a “Volunteer Wranglers” coordinator**\! Do you have experience recruiting, organizing, and directing volunteers? Are you excited by the meta-challenge of recruiting, organizing, and directing the volunteers who’ll tackle this alongside you? And most importantly—are you willing to do what’s needed to get _fandom people_ working together in pursuit of a better fandom web? Let us know by filling our Volunteers Coordinator application form.
- **\[🙏\] Betas seek Alpha:** FujoGuide is **looking for a beta readers coordinator**\! The task, for those who choose to accept it, is to sit patiently in a Discord group DMs with other 6-7 fannish beginners as they brave our GitHub issue of FujoGuide and (with your guidance) surface unscathed\! You don’t need deep expertise of GitHub to take on this challenge, just be familiar enough with branching, merging, and the pull request process to help people get unstuck. Ideally, we’d like to keep this a volunteer position as it’s traditionally been, but we’d be happy to barter zines, knowledge, or other merch for payment in kind\! DM us or write us at [contacts@fujocoded.com](mailto:contacts@fujocoded.com) to apply.
- **\[💰\] Technical ~~Project~~ Procyon Manager:** Sun Tzu said, “_if you know not yourself, \[...\] you will lose half your battles_”. Luckily, we don’t just _know_ our weaknesses, we know how to _fix_ them. So we’ll be starting 2026 **getting Ms Boba some Project Management ~~emotional~~ support**: have experience wrangling milestones in legible dashboards? love pestering (and guiding\!) people who owe deliverables? Apply here and come help FujoCoded move away from project charts only Ms Boba can read, and free her brain from the woes of keeping folks on track\! This is a temporary, part-time position to help us regroup and set up a working system.

## That’s All, Fujin\!

Phew, what a journey\! Thank _you_ for reading (_or skimming_) all the way down.

We can't wait to see you in the next year (and newsletter), with ~~even
more~~ _a moderate quantity of new_ updates. Since not quite as much time will pass—we
pinkie swear!—we _hope_ the update might will look thinner, but not for that less
meaty.

As always, _quality over quantity, mind over matter, seme over
uke._

Happy 2026,  
Your friends @ FujoCoded LLC
