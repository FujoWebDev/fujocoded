- **Cookies Complete:** The Fandom Cookies digital pack is out at last: **[head to our store _right now_](https://store.fujocoded.com/products/other/fandom-cookies-digital-items-pack) to learn to build your own fortune generator website\!** This pack includes a ton of content, featuring a full set of wallpapers and digital goodies [from fannish artists](https://bsky.app/profile/fujocoded.bsky.social/post/3m724cmhhrk2g), alongside our HTML/CSS/JavaScript learn-along _“with heavily commented code for beginners stepping up”._ And if you buy it _now,_ **you’ll also get a discount for the ✨fancy edition✨** (for future release), which builds upon the regular pack to help you master _\~even fancier\~,_ more advanced CSS, JS, and HTML techniques.

- **Executive Release:** In the spirit of _baiting two seme with one uke_, our Digital Pack release did not just deliver _over 120_ of them, “freebies” included, **it _also_ showed us how we’d fare with a prolonged release campaign\!** Let’s just say with only one Ms Boba and many, many cookies (and threads), we did have to [crowdsource our executive function](https://bsky.app/profile/fujocoded.bsky.social/post/3m4eiw4xxh22u). Thankfully, we also engaged the socials-wrangling help of [queercatboy](http://fujocoded.com/contributors/gqueercatboy) and Elendraug. Next launch campaign challenge… FujoGuide Issue 1? 👀

- **Documentation Depot:** Behold, our latest (a)live-but-in-progress site, [community.fujocoded.com](https://community.fujocoded.com/) (or “_community@_”, for friends)\! Here we’ll stock up all of our **resources on community building and governance**, set up more **central documentation for our libraries**, and share some of the **internal FujoCoded know-hows** for everyone's eyes. Huge thanks to our friend [Gingerchew](https://github.com/gingerchew) for helping us style it with some fujo-flair\!

- **Very Important Progress:** The exclusive lounge for our Big Money spenders—that is, our $upporters area—is coming together nicely. The VIPs who [get past the velvet rope](https://patreon.com/fujocoded) will soon **get access to secret shops, discount codes, and the ability to emblazon their blorbo on a wall for all to see** (_old-timers may remember BobaBoard’s [“Volunteers Blorbo Wall”](https://bobaboard.com/blorbos-wall-2022)_). [Touchofstatic](https://github.com/touchofstatic), our webdev for hire did a great job giving the site a first coat of style and code, while [our long-term contractor Ria](https://fujocoded.com/contributors/ria) pulled Stripe PayPal, and Patreon’s heads out of their collective ~~asses~~ APIs to set up the user database.

- **Cleaning Up Our ~~Act~~ Mart:** With the digital pack buyers at our doors, **we carved up the time—and _adrenaline_—to tidy up [the FujoCoded store](https://store.fujocoded.com/).** In record time, we’ve added a ton of missing stuff like card backgrounds that help stickers pop, on-click image magnification (so you can see what you’re buying), and even made it _much, much_ faster to load\! For the animated Disney-style montage of the raccoon(girl)s working their cleaning magic, throw us a few hundred bucks and we’ll see what we can do.

- **Software Shippers:** …and finally, we’ve kept on shipping both blorbos and software libraries\! You’ll find the in-depth update, covering everything from more [AO3.js functionality](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/AO3.js) to the ([re)rise of Astrolabe](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/astrolabe) in the [“in the Git(hub)” section below](#in-the-github). For now, simply join us in cheering our hired hand [Haetae](https://bsky.app/profile/haetae.cozy.fan) who braved Authproto’s code to give ~~it~~ us a README, a folder of usage examples, and a whole series of bug discoveries\!
