## FujoCoded Backerkit Update

> **Editor's Note:** BackerKit funds helped launch learn@ by funding our Terminal and NPM series, so we'll be officially including all progress here from here on out\!

### FujoCoded BackerKit Fulfillment Progress: Recent

- **Workshopping Writers:** Our [friend and article writer Rie](https://fujocoded.com/contributors/rie) took [our existing learn@ style guide](https://community.fujocoded.com/fujowebdev/) into their own hands (and wisdom). After giving our existing guidelines a very-needed coat of polish and clarity, **they used their experience to concoct a better article writing AND review process**—all this so we can spread our (free) knowledge faster and more sustainably\! If that was not enough, they’re now test-driving this same process, **guiding a kind volunteer in reviewing the [Terminal series you funded](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/quickstarts/terminal-quickstart/) (🙏)** and upgrading it to fit our latest guidelines.

- **Amicable Divorce:** Ms Boba’s been breaking up marriages again, this time **splitting up our [NPM articles](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/npm/javascript-beyond-websites-nodejs) into more focused and approachable (not to mention less scary) chunks.** Hand-on exercises—like [Running NodeJS programs](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/npm/your-first-node-program/) and [Learn and Practice NPM](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/npm/npm-in-practice/)—are now cozily settled in their single-occupancy home(page)s, so you can head directly to your preferred learning avenue, or more easily link your friends to the exact skills they seek.

- **Shoot for the Stars**: Behold the outline of our [Astro learning path](https://leaflet.pub/117c41f5-52a5-4a9d-9b42-f8d4c3a6c6fe)\! As the [last newsletter](https://fujocoded.com/updates/25-08-16-sisyphus-rises) foretold, the collective hive-mind gathered forth in our [Astro stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2556015846) to ponder the missing pieces in the existing Astro docs. The verdict? While they’re excellent for people starting a website from scratch, **Astro's docs lack guidance for those wishing to upgrade their handcrafted sites—a significant portion of our own target audience\!** We have, _alas_, not yet placed this “jump on the Astro rocket without leaving your site behind” series in our schedule, but we’re eager to start as our current articles (and other assorted obligations) wind down.

### FujoCoded BackerKit Fulfillment Progress: Future

- **NVM Extras:** We’ve had your first batch of NPM articles, yes, but what about a _second batch_? In the very first partnership of its kind, **the BobaBoard Docs Bubble**—aka, _sociocratic circle_—**collectively drafted an installation guide for NVM**—aka, _Node Version Manager_—which is our recommended avenue of getting access to NodeJS—aka, [_JavaScript but outside the Browser_](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/npm/javascript-beyond-websites-nodejs/). Next up, we’ll add this guide to learn@ to **help people install NodeJS _the proper way_ by <u>not</u> installing it**. A huge thank you to “The Docs”, our <em>doc</em>-torly bunch who all prefer the cover of anonymity, for their much better write-up on this complicated relationship\!

- **Governance and You:** With [community@](https://community.fujocoded.com/) up and ready, we can **start filling it up with some currently-internal guides on [Sociocracy](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/)**, the collective governance system FujoVerse™ projects are working to adopt and evangelize. This “_working in communities_” learning area is also where the “_Dealing with Interpersonal Conflict_” article this campaign funded will live… as soon as we’ve set up our existing writing commitments up for success, and we’re ready to tackle more writing—in both _quantity_ and _ambition_.
