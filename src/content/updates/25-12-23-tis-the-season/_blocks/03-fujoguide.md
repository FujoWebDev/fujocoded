## The Fujoshi Guide to Web Development

### Recent Progress on FujoGuide

- **Hyena in the Docs House:** Our _Volume 0 Issue 2 (GitHub)_ beta readers spoke clearly: while Issue 1 dropped ‘em straight into the HTML-dress-up action (_good_), **Issue 2 took too long to get to the point, which hurt the experience** (_bad_). To fix this, we once again Hired our [Humble, Helpful, Hardworking-Hand, Hyena](https://fujocoded.com/contributors/hyena) to Heroically Herd our Hypertext and Hone our Headlines—that is, to **rewrite the beginning of our Issue 2 as [articles for learn@](https://learn.fujoweb.dev/git/git-settings/)**, and make this catb… erm, _extra content_ a free-for-all. Progress is ongoing!

- **Delivering Digital Demos**: Little-known fact about our digital pack: far from just serving as our probe into today’s “fujin-targeted webdev education” market, **it was also conceived as a test run for the release of FujoGuide Issue 1** (which is currently gnawing at its containment crate as it begs for the sweet release of…well, _release_). But while this _push_ gave us the _push_ to upgrade our shop for digital deliveries, it also _pushed_ our current capacity—that is, it showed us **the need for a more sustainable system for long-running hype campaigns**…a must-solve for next year\!

- **Searching for Iss-_you_ 2:** The re-drafting and re-beta’ing of Issue 2 hit—alas, _unfortunately_, but perhaps _appropriately_—_2_ snags. The first one (now resolved) was Ms Boba’s teaching energy getting _Denial-of-Service_’d by dual-wielding the digital learn-along release and the hand-off of learn@ articles to new writers. The second one (still pending) is that **one of our longest-time friends, collaborators, and in this case _corral-er of beta readers_ had to suddenly step back for personal reasons.** So as they say, dear readers, _the search is on_: are you—_yes, you\!_—willing to use your Version Control knowledge to **help our _betas_ safely take on a treacherous _alpha_ (our _GitHub zine)_?** Let us know [in the "collaborate with us" section below](#collaborate-with-us)\!

### What’s Next for FujoGuide

- **No Dodging this Draft:** With the new year rising, we’ll unwrap ourselves from other predicaments and re-wrap our focus around the coordination of Issue 2 Beta \#2—this means **both wrapping up the second draft, and unwrapping a shiny, new wrangler for our betas.** The holiday haze may slow things down, but we don’t expect the search to take long: we _do run_ a community full of the most helpful and generous coders in fandom, after all\! Once a coordinator is found, however, we still need to fit a lot of hands, heads, and schedules together, and **give people enough time to go through the guide (and, later, the feedback)** at a comfortable pace. We’ll keep you up to date on our socials\!

- **Eyes on the Prize:** We’ve [recently answered a question](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/essential-randomness/the-fujoshi-guide-to-web-development/comments) about the longer than planned production for this FujoGuide Kickstarter campaign. If you’ve been feeling a little lost, **we hope it’ll explain why we _broadened_ our educational strategy before digging _deeper_ into the delivery of these zines**, and how we converged on two longer but more effective books. From the bottom of our hearts: _thank you_—not only for your patience and support, but for giving us the space to tackle webdev education in the way we believe is most effective. Rest assured: **we _ourselves_ cannot wait to put these zines into your hands, and we’ll make it our priority throughout 2026\.** Onwards, and (as always) beyond\!
