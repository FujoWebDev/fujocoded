## Intermission — A Word _to_ our $ponsors

**This update (and our ongoing work) is brought to you by our lovely Patrons\!** Couldn’t keep this running without y’all—raccoons need _so much_ food, and don’t even get us started on their _unquenchable thirst for doujinshi_.

If you’ve not already boarded our _ship_, [jump on our Patreon now](https://www.patreon.com/c/fujocoded)\! Tiers start at $3/month, and give you access to coupons and—see [our FujoStore highlights](#fujostore-highlights-restocks-sales-and-limited-time-offers) below 👀—priority access to discounted or limited-edition merchandise. **You’ll soon even be able to showcase your blorbo [on a big wall](https://bobaboard.com/blorbos-wall-2022)\!**

**Did you know?** Studies show [our Patrons](https://www.patreon.com/c/fujocoded) are 30% more likely to receive long in-depth fanfiction of their rarepairs _(it’s true, we swear)_\!

## Around the FujoVerse

### In the Press

- **Houston, We Have a Badge**: The internet (as you know) is all about _one_ thing: making _friends_. And not only did our Astro “learning path” stream deepen our friendship with the Astro team, it directly led to the creation of [the official “Friends of Houston” badge](https://github.com/louisescher/astro-webrings/blob/master/packages/astro-webrings/src/images/friends-of-houston.gif)\! After hearing us sing the praises of Houston (Astro’s mascot and goodest robot since WALL-E), not to mention their sway with ~~the ladies~~ Static-Site-Generator-seeking _fujin_, **the Astro team concocted this badge _and_ [a webring to go with it](https://astro-webrings.lou.gg/)**, so _everyone_ can now become Houston’s special friend.

- **Posting Through AT**: Social networks (as you _also_ know) are about _many things_, but chiefly they’re about the collective pondering of The Ultimate Question of Life, the Web, and the Blogosphere: “how does one _leave_ the ones they’re on?” Speaking of which, the FujoVerse™ has been bristling with ATproto discussions, with Fandom Coders’ very own [Bluedreaming](https://bluedream.ing/) writing **[an overview of ATproto's various parts](https://bluedreaming.dreamwidth.org/75226.html) so folks can learn how to _Bluesky_ (network) without _Bluesky_ (company).** [Ms Boba also went live](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2596637498) to read aloud, correct, expand this article, _not to_ mention _pepper it_ with ~~discourse~~ Spicy Ramblings™ of her own.

- **Interview with the AppView:** As the ATproto discussion got sizzling, a clear trend emerged on Fandom Coders: while many quickly grasped the whats and whys of Personal Data Servers, _AppViews_ left folks perplexed if not _outright confused_. So, to help our community talk about—_and maybe build?_ 👀—new ways to connect across the interwebs, **Ms Boba wrote [a whole explanatory article on AppViews](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/lexicon-guestbook/tree/main/appview).** Then, to top this off with a noteworthy (and very much needed) final bow, she engaged the help of tech activist [thisismissem](https://hachyderm.io/@thisismissem) to help her **understand and explain [the functional difference between ATproto AppViews and ActivityPub software like Mastodon](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/lexicon-guestbook/tree/maiyn/appview#decentralized-federated-software).**

### In the Git(hub)

- **Autorelease of Our Own:** As the FujoVerse™ grows, so must our ability to keep up with its pace—which means **we’ve started adding _autorelease_ to our libraries\!** This process automatically keeps track of code changes, builds a list of new features, and lets us quickly release new versions into the wild. You can witness [our first such release](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/AO3.js/releases/tag/v0.22.1) on `@fujocoded/ao3.js` (formerly `@bobaboard/ao3.js`). Among the latest features: tag search, fetching work content, non-AO3 archives support, and download URLs\!

- **Astrolabe’s Blasting Off (Again):** Long-time friends may remember Astrolabe, the “universal rich text editor for multi-platform content” we’ve been chipping away at since, well…_almost_ our origins\! Now, with our ATproto connections bemoaning the need for something Astrolabe-shaped, we’re once again set on making “_fetch”_ happen: **Ms Boba has been slowly publishing her private plugins while polishing the Astrolabe repo** (check out the [new `README`](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/astrolabe) and [latest Storybook](https://astrolabe-editor.netlify.app/?path=/story/adapters-starter-bluesky--link-and-underline)), upgrading libraries to the latest version, and experimenting with loading posts from other socials ([like Leaflet](https://astrolabe-editor.netlify.app/?path=/story/adapters-starter-leaflet-from--base-lexicon)) or [decentralized ATproto emoji](https://astrolabe-editor.netlify.app/?path=/story/astrolabe-emoji--editable-multiple-sets%20). Alongside her, fellow **BobaBoard Builders Bubble member Sel has been working on making Spoilers accessible to screen readers** as he familiarizes himself with the codebase. Want to join ‘em? Read on 👀👇

- **Join the Cult:** What’s better than us adding new functionality to our open source projects? Helping _you_—yes you\!—do the same\! The BobaBoard Builders Bubble recently banded together to **open <u>contributor-friendly</u> issues for both [AO3.js](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/ao3.js/issues) and [Astrolabe](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/astrolabe/issues)**, so people like _you_—yes you\!—can come show (or learn) how it’s done\! So look around, **swing by, throw some code at the wall, and come ask for help if lost\!** These’ll look great on your resume, portfolio, _and_ Hinge profile, we swear.

- **A Plethora of Plugins:** While the aforementioned autorelease will (eventually) help communicate our changes in an efficient and orderly manner, we _unfortunately_ aren’t quite there _yet_, so…**here’s a quick roundup of updates** \*deep breath\*: [haetae](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:dg2qmmjic7mmecrbvpuhtvh6) has been working doubletime to add README and examples to [authproto](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/fujocoded-plugins/tree/main/astro-authproto), we’ve been prototyping [friends-only Astro page functionality](https://bsky.app/profile/essentialrandom.bsky.social/post/3m2sr75baak2r), [cross-posting to Bluesky from your very own blog](https://bsky.app/profile/essentialrandom.bsky.social/post/3m3vnbhi3rc2h), and [fetching your latest social contacts](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/fujocoded-plugins/tree/webc-pds-links/webcomponent-pds-links) from your own PDS; we’ve also been pumping [our Guestbook](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/lexicon-guestbook/) full of moderation goodness, like blocking users, hiding submissions, and deleting guestbooks\! At this stage, it is [almost ready for launch](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/lexicon-guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#todo-list), awaiting a final deliberation on text formatting while our sysadmin [Kat](https://fujocoded.com/contributors/kat) sets it up to run on our server); and we’d be remiss not to mention tools built for our own use, like syncing our collaborators repository with [our website’s “contributors” folder](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/fujocoded/blob/main/scripts/sync-contributors.ts) (making it much easier to credit appropriately), or [centralizing and standardizing](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/.github/tree/main/.github/workflows) our deploy scripts.

### Our Streaming Schedule

Ms Boba loves [streaming](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/streams)—or so say the _allegations_—but it’s hard to juggle a stable schedule while also corralling a horde of raccoons in a vaguely-cohesive direction. Which is why, we’re _NOT_ going to promise any particular schedule right now: we’ll make **our best effort to maintain the Monday & Thursdays at 3PM tradition**, and let you know on our socials if any special stream gets scheduled\!

For the rest, come discover what’s up, get Ms Boba to rant about your favorite pet topic (she’s _very_ easy to bait), or just co-work with us while we cry over code\! Whether on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/essentialrandomness) or [Streamplace](https://stream.place/essentialrandom.bsky.social), **you know where (and when) to find us**_**…mostly\!**_
