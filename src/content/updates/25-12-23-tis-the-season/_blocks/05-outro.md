## That’s All, Fujin\!

Phew, what a journey\! Thank _you_ for reading (_or skimming_) all the way down.

We can't wait to see you in the next year (and newsletter), with ~~even
more~~ _a moderate quantity of new_ updates. Since not quite as much time will pass—we
pinkie swear!—we _hope_ the update will look thinner, but not for that less
meaty.

As always, _quality over quantity, mind over matter, seme over
uke._

Happy 2026,  
Your friends @ FujoCoded LLC
