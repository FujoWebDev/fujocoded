Astrolabe

Rich Text Editor, plugins, and content adapters for fandom and ATmosphere-friendly editors.

Astrolabe is a block-based Rich Text Editor which aims to provide a simple, extensible, and modern text editing experience to be reused across projects and provide a bridge across platforms.

It consists of two main parts:

Plugins, components that extend the TipTap editor with new features and functionality.
Adapters, libraries to translate between the output of the editor and the API of modern social platforms, using Remark/Mdast as a translation layer.
