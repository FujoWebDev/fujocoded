A screencap of the Fortune Cookie learn along, showing the finished UI annotated with features. It is titled "Learn along as we build a fortune generator: Select a Flavor, Press a Button, Get a Fortune" and shows a text output window reading "Seek a fortune, if you dare" above a radio-button selector for cookie flavour (Vanilla, Chocolate, Lemon) and a "Get a Fortune" button. Each feature is labelled including "Centred, single-column layout"; "Pages, text, and images where you want them, at any size"; "visual and practical instructions"; "and more" listing features like accessibility, extra  exercises, and reacting to user actions. 

Boba-Tan is sitting on top of the output box, eating a fortune cookie.
