A screencap of the Fortune Cookie learn along. A white and grey circuit-board
background, with a cream block in the center. Within the cream block is an image
mimicking a webpage, with a yellow border, red columns on each side, and a cream
background. Boba-tan, with a fortune cookie moustache, stands in the top middle.
Below is a white text box with red border, saying "seek a fortune if you dare",
and options for vanilla, chocolate, or lemon cookie flavors. White text with
black outline reads: "Learn along as we build a fortune generator-- select a
flavor, push a button, get a fortune!" Text below that outlines what is
included: a centered single column layout; visual and practical interactions;
pages, texts, and images where you want them, at any size, and more! Features
are listed on the top right, with black text on a white text box outlined in
black. Inside a black text field with white text, at the bottom right, there are
more detailed features listed. These feature boxes highlight the approachable
nature of the learn along, professional knowledge included, and customizable
nature of the product.
