        <strong>
          FujoCoded LLC's mission is to build a kinder, more diverse, more
          collaborative–and, yes, <em>more weird</em>!–internet.
        </strong> To this end, we leverage our extensive experience within online
        fandom communities, along with the many skills at our disposal, to devise
        engaging ways to help people take charge of their online world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our main focuses are:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Education</strong>, which gives people the skills to be the
            change they want to see on the web.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Software</strong>, which gives people the tools to make such
            changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Community</strong>, which gives people the strength,
            structure, and support to see those changes through.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our emphasis is on working with niche online subcultures (starting with <a
          href="/fujoshi">fujoshi</a
        > and fandom) to help them build their technical and collaboration skills.
        As part of this we:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>foster communities for learning and connection</li>
          <li>promote the adoption of open and decentralized software</li>
          <li>
            identify and popularize tools that fit the needs of fannish coders
            (as well as <a href="/projects">creating some ourselves</a>).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, we identify individuals in our community with the potential
        to become leaders in their own right, and provide them with the
        resources and mentorship they need to succeed. You can meet some of them
        in our <a href="/about#our-contractors">contractors section</a>.

      <p class="m-0 px-5 pb-3">
        A new era of the web is approaching: web development technologies grow
        more powerful and accessible; decentralized social networks continue to
        gain steam; users grow increasingly disillusioned with online
        institutions that used to seem inescapable.
      </p>
      <p class="m-0 px-5 pb-5">
        However, even as many wish for change, most feel powerless to help bring
        it about. As turmoil and instability grows, there is no better time to
        rethink who gets to join the conversation on the next era of the web.

        Our founder, contractors, and community contributors have experience in
        a large variety of endeavors: building large-scale software
        applications, moderation and community building, managing open source
        projects, decentralized technologies, and technical (and non-technical)
        writing. You can see some of what we’ve built so far

            Throughout the years, we've hired folks from the fandom community to
            help with art, writing, software development and more. While some
            were established professionals, we're proud to have been others'
            first dive into the tech industry. If you're interested in hiring
            from a diverse set of amazing and hardworking individuals, check out
            their websites!

          Nothing we do would be possible without the help of our community

          Their help has been invaluable. Their contributions include writing,
          community moderation, moral support, specialized expertise, software
          development, and so much more.
