    <h1>About <em>FujoCoded LLC</em></h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        <strong>
          FujoCoded LLC's mission is to build a kinder, more diverse, more
          collaborative–and, yes, <em>more weird</em>!–internet.
        </strong> To this end, we leverage our experience living the web from within
        fandom communities, along with the many skills at our disposal, to devise
        engaging ways to help people take charge of their online world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our main focuses are:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Education</strong>, which gives people the skills they need
            to lead the change they want to see.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Software,</strong> which gives people the tools and opportunities
            to make these changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Community</strong>, which gives people the strength and
            support they need to see those changes through.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our emphasis is on working with niche online subcultures (starting with <a
          href="/fujoshi">fujoshi</a
        > and fandom) to help them build their technical and collaboration skills.
        As part of this, we foster communities for learning and connection, promote
        the adoption of open and decentralized software, and identify and popularize
        tools that are a good fit for the needs of fannish coders (as well as <a
          href="/projects">creating some ourselves</a
        >).
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to all this, we identify individuals in our community with
        the potential to become leaders in their own right, and provide them
        with the resources and mentorship they need to succeed. You can meet
        some of them in our <a href="/about#contractors">contractors section</a
        >.

      <p class="m-0 px-5 pb-3">
        A new era of the web is approaching: web development technologies grow
        more powerful and accessible; decentralized social networks continue to
        gain steam; users grow increasingly disillusioned with online
        institutions that used to seem inescapable.
      </p>
      <p class="m-0 px-5 pb-5">
        However, even as many wish for change, most feel powerless to help
        bringing it about. As turmoil and instability grows, there is no better
        time to rethink who gets to join the conversation on the next era of the
        web.

      <h2>Our Team</h2>
      <p>
        Our founder, contractors, and community contributors have experience in
        a large variety of endeavors: building large-scale software
        applications, moderation and community building, managing open source
        projects, decentralized technologies, and technical (and non-technical)
        writing. You can see some of what we’ve built until now
        <a href="/projects">on our projects page</a>.

          <p>
            Throughout the years, we've hired folks from the fandom community to
            help with art, writing, software development and more. While some
            were established professionals, we're proud to have been others'
            first dive into the tech industry. If you're interested in hiring
            from a diverse set of amazing and hardworking individuals, check out
            their websites!

          Nothing we do would be possible without the help of our community
          contributors who have generously donated their time to the cause.
          Their help has been invaluable. Their contributions include writing,
          community moderation, moral support, specialized expertise, software
          development, and so much more.
