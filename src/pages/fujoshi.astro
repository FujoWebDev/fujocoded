        Fujoshi (lit. "rotten woman") is a pejorative name given to fans of <abbr
          title="Boys Love">BL</abbr
        >
        for not meeting the social expectations imposed on women. In the early 2000s,

        female, queer, and neurodivergent millennials seeking to explore their sexuality
        outside of the normative constraints of society. In recent years, the term
        "fujoshi" has been reclaimed by fans of the genre, with the fujin variant

          Fujoshis are the backbone that online fandoms are built upon. It is a
          highly diverse group of loosely-aligned folks that are often the
          hidden backbone of media fandom. While historically (and globally)
          reviled, Fujoshi have persevered in their ways, carrying series to
          success and creating some of the best content on the web, while seeing
          their own contributions denigrated and diminished, and fielding
          attacks by other groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you struggle to understand fujoshi as their own culture: you can
          think of them as the cousins of furries. Rather than dressing up in
          costumes (most of the time), we write fanfiction and discuss fictional
          characters. We generally focus on shipping fictional characters–often
          men, but with other gender expressions on the rise alongside them.
        </p>
        <p>
          While historically tied to BL, being a fujin these days is, in our own
          conception, a specific way of interacting with media and fandom,
          taking a transformative approach to media and freely, joyfully, and
          <em>unapologetically</em> sharing your socially-perplexing hyperfixation
          with exploring fictional relationship with others on the web. Overall,
          fujin are the queer, kinky, neurodivergent "id" of the internet–often weird,
          but overall harmless.

          Why <em class="text-white drop-shadow-lg shadow-fujo-purple">fujin</em
          >?
        </h2>
        <p>
          In the past, we've closely aligned our work with the "transformative
          fandom"/shipping community. While our target overall hasn't changed,
          we've decided to more explicitly focus on the fujin community for a
          few reasons:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            As transformative fandom become more mainstream, being the type of
            fan that writes fanfiction or draws fanarts (or any other popular
            shipping activity) has stopped carrying the stigma it did in the
            past. However, the stigma against Fujin remains strong.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fujin, like transformative fandom, have been the canaries in the
            coalmine for some of the issues that have recently become more
            widespread in online communities. Since its inception, Fujin culture
            has been denigrated and dismissed. Especially in modern times, the
            backlash against Fujin has been driven by transphobic anti-LGBT
            groups and subjected to attack by conservative and sex-negative
            groups.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fujin better represents the" millenial viewpoint" of our founder and
            other members of our community. While we have members of all ages,
            our work is inexorably tied to the experiences of those who grew up
            (and learned to ship) in the web of the early 2000s.
          </li>
          <p>
            Regardless of the term we use, our work remains broadly applicable
            and inclusive of any type of online subculture that celebrates the
            freedom to be yourself on the internet, even outside of the norms of
            society. We’re using fujoshi as a stand-in term for a type of
            inoffensive online weirdo that just wants to be weird and do their
            own thing in their corner, whether that is intensely shipping two or
            more fictional characters, obsessively collecting random facts about
            their favorite series, or participating in a subculture that may be
            hard to experience outside of the norm.
