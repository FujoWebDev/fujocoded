    <h1>What is a fujoshi?</h1>
    <p>
      <span class="text-fujo-pink">Fujoshi</span> (lit. "rotten woman") is a pejorative
      name given to Japanese fans of <abbr title="Boys Love" class="cursor-help"
        >BL</abbr
      > media for going against social expectations of femininity. In the early 2000s,
      as the popularity of anime and manga soared internationally, online BL spaces
      became a haven for (often female, queer, and/or neurodivergent) millennials
      seeking to explore their sexuality outside of normative constraints. This has
      lead to the term being adopted more widely.
    </p>
    <p>
      In recent years, <span class="text-fujo-pink">fujoshi</span> has been reclaimed
      by fans of the genre. The <span class="text-fujo-pink">fujin</span> variant
      (lit. "rotten person") is being popularized alongside it to more correctly
      represents the diversity of the community.

    <h2>Fujoshi today</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="text-fujo-pink">Fujoshi</span> (or, more inclusively, <em
        >fujin</em
      >) have always been an integral part of online and offline fandom

      passion for their favorite series often drive the success of <a

    <p>
      Overall, fujin are a highly diverse group of loosely-aligned folks brought
      together by their shared love of <abbr title="Boys Love">BL</abbr> relationships.
      Online-minded folks can think of them as the cousins of the furry subculture,
      with whom they share similar challenges, including stigmatization and censorship.
      Rather than creating works focused on anthropomorphized animals, fujin center
      their own stories, art, comics, and complex fictional worlds around fictional
      relationships from pre-existing media–often between men, but with other gender
      expressions on the rise alongside them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our own conception, and with the evolving face of the community within
      an increasingly sex-negative web, being a fujin has morphed into a
      specific way of doing fandom. Fujin freely, joyfully, and
      <em>unapologetically</em> share their socially-stigmatized hyperfixation with
      fictional relationship with each other, no matter how "rotten" society might
      consider them to be. They are the often queer, kinky, neurodivergent, and disabled
      <em>id</em> of the internet–frequently weird, sometimes perplexing, but overall
      harmless and full of unbridled passion.

    <h2>Why fujin?</h2>
    <p>
      In the past, we've closely aligned our work with the "transformative
      fandom"/shipping community. While our target overall hasn't changed, we've
      decided to more explicitly focus on the fujin community for a few reasons:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
      <li>
        As transformative fandom become more mainstream, being the type of fan
        that writes fanfiction or draws fanarts (or any other popular shipping
        activity) has stopped carrying the stigma it did in the past. However,
        the stigma against Fujin remains strong.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fujin, like transformative fandom, have been the canaries in the
        coalmine for some of the issues that have recently become more
        widespread in online communities. Since its inception, Fujin culture has
        been denigrated and dismissed. Especially in modern times, the backlash
        against Fujin has been driven by transphobic anti-LGBT groups and
        subjected to attack by conservative and sex-negative groups.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fujin better represents the" millenial viewpoint" of our founder and
        other members of our community. While we have members of all ages, our
        work is inexorably tied to the experiences of those who grew up (and
        learned to ship) in the web of the early 2000s.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Regardless of the term we use, our work remains broadly applicable and
      inclusive of any type of online subculture that celebrates the freedom to
      be yourself on the internet, even outside of the norms of society. We’re
      using fujoshi as a stand-in term for a type of inoffensive online weirdo
      that just wants to be weird and do their own thing in their corner,
      whether that is intensely shipping two or more fictional characters,
      obsessively collecting random facts about their favorite series, or
      participating in a subculture that may be hard to experience outside of
      the norm.
    </p>
    <h2>Famous fujin</h2>
    <div>
      As an often-denigrated, underground subculture, fujin are rarely open
      about their involvement in the community. However, here's a small list of
      fujin you may have heard about before.
    </div>

            <FujoCard {...fujin.data} />
          </li>
        ))
