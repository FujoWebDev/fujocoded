      > Taken together, these projects form an ecosystem that rests on the same pillars

      <p>They fall within these categories:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Libraries</strong>, like <a href="#ao3-js">AO3.js</a>, that
          provide an opportunity for contributors to strengthen their coding
          skills and tools fannish folks can use for their own projects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Software,</strong> like <a href="#bobaboard">BobaBoard</a>,
          that fills fannish needs not satisfied by the current web and provides
          another chance for collaboration.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Communities</strong>, like <a href="#fandom-coders"
            >Fandom Coders</a
          >, where people can form new friendships or find support during their
          coding journey.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Educational books and articles</strong>, like <a
            href="#the-fujoshi-guide-to-web-development"
            >the Fujoshi Guide to Web Development</a
          >, to give people the skills to collaborate on our projects or create
          their own.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Commerce</strong>, like <a href="#robinboob">RobinBoob</a> and
          <a href="#fujoboard">Fujoboard</a>, to help fund our work and maintain
          awareness of our goals among our followers and beyond.

      <h2><em>FujoVerse™</em> Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Projects maintained or led by FujoCoded. While generally done on a
        "best-effort" basis, they're a key part of our overarching plan. Your
        support helps with their continued development and growth.

        to the contributors of each project.
