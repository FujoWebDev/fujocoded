## Definitions

- **Subscriber:** you
- **Third Party:** Any service or platform not owned or
  managed by Ms Boba, aka essentialrandomness.

## II. Services

The primary offer here is access to Ms Boba's content and work itself. Through
subscribing or supporting through other listed means (unless stated otherwise),
what you receive in return _is_ access to Ms Boba's knowledge and skillset. This
includes but is not limited to exclusive or non-exclusive access to Ms Boba's
blogs, newsletters, streams, coding repos, and other digital media. In some (but
not all) cases, supporters may also receive early or limited access to some
items. While Ms Boba may offer services, products, and events in return for your
subscription, there is no guarantee that anything specific will materialize.

Any current offers to subscribers and projects actively being worked on by Ms
Boba will be available to view on
[Projects](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/projects) and by reading her
[Blog](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/posts).

## III. Opt-out

Any purchases made are subject to the terms laid out by the platform the
purchase was made on.

their chosen service. If a service already paid for is not desired, it can be
opted out by contacting Ms Boba. Ms Boba is not responsible for anything missed
by the subscriber during the Opt-out periods.

## IV. Non-Payment

Non-payment for services or a lapse in payment can result in subscription
cancellation. Ms Boba is not responsible for anything missed by the subscriber
during the non-payment periods.

## V. Privacy Policy

Data collected from subscribers is limited to data collected by the platforms
that provide payment and subscription services (PayPal, Stripe, Patreon and Ko-fi),
as well as Buttondown, our newsletter provider.

These may include:

- Names, email addresses, physical addresses
- Card numbers or banking information (for recurring payments or user profiles)
- Information tied to accounts on thirds parties used to subscribe and purchase
  from Ms Boba
- Orders and transactions history

Ms Boba is not responsible for the management or protection of
publicly accessible information. The data collected is used only to:

  tier)
- Alert subscriber of changes to service agreements or services offered

### Who can access subscriber data?

- Ms Boba
- 3rd parties helping Ms Boba with legal compliance (e.g. accountant)
- Law enforcement, as required by law

Subscriber data may also be accessed by 3rd parties helping Ms Boba with data
entry and processing, for example to help match subscription data across
services, or debug issues with automations. In this case, effort will be taken to
restrict access to the minimum amount of time necessary, and provide as limited
access as possible.

This privacy policy is only subject to services offered through
essentialrandomness and does not extend off site or to third party services. The
subscriber should refer to the off site or third party service’s privacy policy
when utilizing them. This includes payment processing through
[Stripe](https://stripe.com/privacy) and
[Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/privacy-full).

### How can I delete subscriber data?

To completely delete your subscriber data, you can [contact Ms
